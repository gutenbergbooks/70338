<hr class="r10">

<p>The present work is founded upon Lectures recently
delivered at the London Institution.</p>

<p>The subject of Paper and Paper Making is one which
has been at all times regarded with considerable interest,
independently of that attention to it which commercial
pursuits, of necessity, demand. The confidence,
however, which originally prompted me to treat the
subject, has, been in no slight degree, augmented by
the advantage which I possess in the experience of
my father, extending over a period of nearly half a
century.</p>

<p>In the illustration of the Lectures, (which here stand
as <span class="smcap">Chapters</span> 1 and 2),—the syllabus furnished by the
London Institution being retained as a heading in each
instance—I have the pleasing duty to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
myself much indebted to the kind assistance of many
friends in connection with the Royal Asiatic Society,
the Hon. East India Company, the Royal Botanical
Gardens at Kew, the London Missionary Museum, and
the Bank of England.</p>

<p>So far as it has been found practicable to illustrate
the present work, no effort has been spared, and in
order to sustain the interest which was so strikingly
exhibited at the delivery of the Lectures—the remembrance
of which throughout life will be to me a constant
source of gratification;—I have appended, amongst other
specimens, a sheet manufactured from the same mould
as I then employed.</p>

<p class="pfs90">BY THE REV. GEORGE CROLY, LL. D.</p>

<hr class="r15">
<p class="noindent">Having been present at the delivery of these
Lectures, and feeling an interest in them, as the
performance of my intelligent friend, and parishioner,
Mr. Herring, I have added, at his
request, a few preliminary observations, on the
chief employment of paper in our day, namely,
in <span class="smcap">Printing</span>.</p>

<p>It is a striking, and perhaps a significant, coincidence,
that the art of making paper from linen
fibre, and the art of printing, were discovered
nearly at the same time, and were coeval with
the first preaching of the Reformation; by Huss
and Jerome of Prague, of whom Luther was only
the more eminent successor—the whole three
events dating from the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It is certain, that printing was the great instrument
of the Reformation in Germany, and of
spreading it through Europe; and it is equally
certain, that the making of paper, by means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
the cotton or flaxen fibre, supplied the only material,
which has been found extensively available
for printing. Whether this coincidence was
simply accidental, or was the effect of that high
arrangement for high purposes, which we so
often find in the history of Providence, may be
left to the consideration of the Christian.</p>

<p>But, it is evident, that if printing had been
invented in any of the earlier ages, it would have
been comparatively thrown away. The Chinese
bark of the bamboo, or the rice straw; the Egyptian
papyrus, and the Greek or Roman parchment,
would have been too feeble, or too expensive,
for the rapid demands of the Press. But,
at the exact period, when Printing was given to
the world, the fabric was also given, which was
to meet the broadest exigency of that most illustrious
invention.</p>

<p>That the Chinese, in ages almost beyond history,
had made paper of cotton, and even of
hemp; and that the Arabians either borrowed, or
invented, the manufacture, in the eighth century,
is known. But, the discovery perished for want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
of the Press; as the Press would have perished
for want of the vigour, yet to be created in every
faculty of human advance, by the Reformation.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten, that the <em>first</em> printed
works were religious; as the “Biblia Pauperum,”
a small folio, of forty leaves, each with a picture,
and a text of Scripture under it; and the “Speculum
humanæ Salvationis,” a similar work of
pictures and texts, in Latin; and that the last,
and noblest, achievement of Printing, has been
the renewed publication of the Gospel, in nearly
every language of the globe!</p>

<p>The actual origin of Printing has been matter
of learned controversy. From the earliest ages,
impressions had been taken from seals. There
are in the British Museum blocks of lead, impressed
with the name or stamp of the Roman
authorities. The Chinese, who seem to have had
a glimpse of every invention of Europe, produced
blocks of wood-engraving, with which they multiplied
copies, by impression at least, so early as
the tenth century; and even appear to have applied
it to a species of bank note. Whether the
invention was introduced into Europe by Marco<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
Polo, (who visited China in the thirteenth century),
or by others, it is known, that printed playing cards
and devotional tracts, (though of the simplest
structure, generally a single page), were not infrequent,
from the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1400. Still, the operation
was so expensive, and, also, so insufficient,
that the Art of Printing cannot be said, to have
been yet discovered. For this discovery, the
essential was the use of <em>moveable types</em>.</p>

<p>The honour of this most simple, yet most
comprehensive, change, has been warmly disputed
by Holland, and Germany. But, though
Coster, a Hollander, adopted it early; general
opinion gives it to Gutenburg, a printer at
Strasburg, between 1436 and 1442. Gutenburg
was originally a block-printer; at length
the fortunate idea occurred to him, of getting rid
of the solid page, and making his types separate;
those, in the first instance, were cut out of wood.
Returning to Mayence, his native city, a partnership
with Faust supplied him with capital.
Faust made a second step in the mechanical
portion of the art, by casting the types in metal.
A subsequent partnership with Schoeffer, Faust’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
son-in-law, supplied all that was wanting to the
art, in his invention of the Punch for making the
types. The partners subsequently quarrelled,
and Gutenburg, in 1458, formed a new establishment
in Mayence. The storming of the city by
Adolphus of Nassau, in 1462, dispersed the workmen,
and thus spread the art through Europe. It
was thenceforth practised in Italy, in France, in
Spain, and in England, (at Westminster, in 1475.)</p>

<p>The <cite>Cologne Chronicle</cite>, printed in 1474, states,
that the first large volume produced by printing,
was the Bible, (an edition of the Vulgate,)
a work which cost a preparation of ten years.
This edition is without date, or printer’s name,
but is supposed to have been completed in 1455.</p>

<p>In an age, when the European mind was only
emerging from a thousand years of darkness,
everything was tinged with superstition. The
<em>printing</em> of the Bible shared the general charge;
and the comparative cheapness, and still more, the
singular fidelity of the copies to each other, were
attributed to sorcery. Faust, who probably had
no objection to a report, by which so much was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
to be gained, and which was favoured by the absence
of date and name; has since been made the
hero of German mysticism; and is immortalized,
as the philosopher, and master of magic, in the
celebrated poem of Goethe.</p>

<p>The Newspaper, the most influential of all
human works, is the <em>creation</em> of Printing. It is
to the honour of England, that in this country,
it approaches nearest to excellence, in intellectual
vigour, in variety of knowledge, in extent of information,
and in patriotic principle. It has,
like all the works of man, occasional imperfections,
and perhaps among the most prominent, are
its too minute details of offences against public
purity. But, there is scarcely a newspaper in
this age, which would not have been regarded as
a triumph of ability, in the last. In fact, the
newspaper of England is the great practical
teacher of the people. Its constant and universal
teaching alone accounts for the superior intelligence
of the population. Schools, lecture-rooms,
and universities, important as they all are, altogether
fall behind it in public effect, or find, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
to retain their influence, they must follow its
steps. Those steps may now and then turn from
the right road, but their native tendency is, forwards
and upwards! This intellectual giant always
advances, and carries the country with him
to a height, which no other country, ancient or
modern, ever attained, or perhaps, ever hoped to
attain.</p>

<p>I speak of this form of publication, in no literary
favoritism; but, as a great instrument,
offered to nations for the safety, the speed, and
the security of national progress; an intellectual
railroad, given to our era, to meet the increased
exigencies of intellectual intercourse; and equal
to any weight, and any rapidity.</p>

<p>The most hopeless feature of foreign governments
appears to me, their hostility to the <em>press</em>.
Thus, they prohibit the mental air and exercise,
which would rectify the “peccant humours”
of their people; thus, they aggravate popular
stagnation into political disease; thus, casual
passion is darkened into conspiracy, and passing
disgust is compressed into rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span></p>

<p>England has her ill-humours, but the press
ventilates them away; the vapours are not suffered
to lie on the ground, until they condense
into malaria. There may be folly, and even faction,
among us, and the press may be the trumpet
of both; but, the width of the area is the remedy.
A <em>whole</em> nation is always right. No sound can
stir it, but the sound which is in accord with its
own feelings; the trumpet which is overwhelming
within four walls, is unheard at the horizon!</p>

<p>If, in an age of foreign convulsion, England
has undergone no catastrophe; if, in the fall of
monarchies, she has preserved her hereditary
throne; if, in the mingled infidelity and superstition
of the Continent, which, like the mingled
frenzy and fetters of a lunatic hospital, have, in
our day, exhibited the lowest humiliation of human
nature; she has preserved her freedom and
her religion; I attribute all, under God, to the
vigour, and intelligence of public investigation;
the incessant urgency of appeal to the public
mind; the living organization, of which the
heart is the <span class="smcap">Press</span> of England!</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous and diversified objects
of human investigation and research, it would,
perhaps, be difficult to single out one, more curious
and interesting, than that of the medium which
bears the symbols of language; which retains
the register of circumstances and events of past
ages, and which hands down to us the transactions
of primeval time, with its intervening periods.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the noblest acquisition of mankind,
perhaps the greatest advantage which we
possess, is that of the faculty of speech. Without
speech, man, in the midst of crowds, would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
solitary. The endearments of friendship, and the
communications of wisdom, alike would become
unavailing; man, in fact, without speech, could
hardly be accounted a rational being.</p>

<p>That the use of speech or language was given
to Adam immediately upon his formation, we
have no reason to doubt; for from the testimony
of Moses it appears, that he not only gave names
to every living creature, “to every beast of the
field, and to every fowl of the air,” as they were
brought to him, but that also as soon as Eve was
made he could say—“This is now bone of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh,” the first sentence
which is recorded of his uttering, and which is
sufficient to show, that even then, he possessed a
competent stock of words to declare the ideas or
conceptions of his mind.</p>

<p>Thus was man at once rendered as superior to
the brute creation, as in after times by the aid of
writing, or the art of drawing those ideas into
vision, he was especially distinguished from the
condition of uncivilized savages. For of all
the arts that contribute to the comfort and
happiness of mankind, no one, perhaps, is more
intimately connected with our social habits, or
more closely entwined with the best and purest
feelings of our nature, than that of writing.
And yet to conceive or to account for the origin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of an art so invaluable in its tendency to elevate
and improve mankind, as that of exhibiting to
sight the various conceptions of the mind, which
have no corporeal forms, by means of hieroglyphics
or legible characters, is still as difficult
and perplexing, as in past ages it has ever proved
to the sagacity of mankind. With the poet of
old we have yet to enquire—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Whence did the wondrous mystic art arise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of painting speech, and speaking to the eyes?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we by tracing magic lines are taught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How to embody, and to colour thought.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the great and manifold blessings
which men have received from this
curious and wonderful invention, it is very
remarkable, as a distinguished writer observes,
that writing, which gives a sort of immortality
to all other things, should, by the disposal
of Divine Providence, be without any trace
of the memory of its first founders. Indeed, the
invention of letters and their various combinations
in forming words, amounting, it is computed,
to 620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000, without repeating
any combination capable of being made
from so small a number of letters as that now comprising
our alphabet, has something so extremely
ingenious and surprising in its application, that
most men who have treated the subject, can
hardly forbear attributing it to a divine original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Many have conceived that the theatre of this
important legacy to man was Mount Sinai. But
it is observable, that previously to the arrival
of the Israelites at Mount Sinai, Scripture makes
mention of writing as an art already understood
by Moses: “And the Lord said unto Moses, <em>write</em>
this for a memorial.” (Exodus, 17th ch. 14th v.)
Now, Moses seems to have expressed no difficulty
of comprehension when he received this command,
nor does anything appear to induce the
slightest doubt; on the contrary, I think we may
safely conclude that Moses was even then well
acquainted with the art of writing, or otherwise
he would have been instructed by God, as in the
case of Noah, when he was required to build the
Ark. And further, we find that Moses wrote all
the words, and all the judgments of the Lord,
contained in the twenty-first and two following
chapters of the Book of Exodus, before the two
written tables of stone were even so much as
promised. The delivery of the tables is not
mentioned till the 18th verse of the 31st chapter,
after God had made an end of communing with
him upon the mount. Nevertheless, I am not
prepared to dispute the probability of a divine
origin to so wonderful a medium, any more than I
am disposed to question the possibility of its
resulting merely from what Aristotle terms the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Faculty of Imitation; for which, says he, men are
so remarkable, even in an uncivilized state. I
pass by all questions of the kind, satisfied for the
present with the simple fact, that such medium
does exist; that through it we become, as it were,
introduced to the multitudinous throng of a world’s
tenantry, while we thus learn their words, works,
and ways, their History, Literature, and Arts,
their Science, and Theology; and while even the
mummy, recovered from the subterranean recesses
of the Egyptian pyramids, may still be
said to talk with us, by virtue of the roll of
papyrus and its pictured inscription which he
holds in his hand;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>In the earliest ages of mankind, very simple
means were necessarily adopted, to preserve the
remembrance of any important event. During
many centuries, tradition, perhaps solely, served to
represent that, which in recent times has been more
completely effected by the introduction of printing.</p>

<p>At other periods we find trees were planted,
heaps of stones, altars or pillars, as we read in
sacred history, were erected; and even games and
festivals ordered, to keep up the recollection of important
facts. Since, however, the art of writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
was invented (be the period when it may), various
materials have from time to time been made use
of, for the purpose of transmitting to posterity
the discoveries and deeds of their ancestors. Thus,
for instance, the most ancient remains of writing
which have been handed down to us, are upon
hard substances, such as bricks, stones, and
metals, which were used by the ancients for all
matters of public notoriety; abundant proofs of
which we have in the recent discoveries of Mr.
Layard. And Josephus, in the third chapter of
the first book of Jewish Antiquities, tells us:
that, “the descendants of Seth, leading a happy
and quiet life, found out by study and observation
the motions and distribution, or order, of
the heavenly bodies; and, that their discoveries
might not be lost to men (knowing that the
destruction of the world had been foretold by
Adam, which should be once by fire, and once by
water,) they made two pillars—one of brick, and
the other of stone, and wrote or engraved their
discoveries thereon; so that if the rains should
destroy that of brick, the other of stone might
continue to show mankind their observations.”</p>

<p>In the sacred text we are further informed,
that great stones were directed to be set up by
the children of Israel, after the passage of the
Jordan, and being “plastered with plaster,”—which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
appears to have been a very common
practice—“thereon were to be written all the
words of the law very plainly.” In the book
of Job, which some suppose to have been
written by Moses, we have an obscure intimation
of the method employed in registering upon
the rock, “graven with an iron pen and lead
in the rock for ever.” But, although there is
apparently a want of clearness in our translation
of the passage, by no means does it affect the idea
of Job’s desire to give the greatest possible permanence
to the words he then uttered. He
exclaims, “Oh that my words were now written,”
or, (though probably not an exact translation,)
“Oh that they were printed in a book;” and
more (he adds) “that they were even graven with
an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever;” which
latter clause some take to be in reference to the
leaden tablets which are found to have been in
very early use. But I rather favour the interpretation,
for which I am indebted, to my much
esteemed friend the Rev. Dr. Croly; that as a
still more indelible and effectual mode of perpetuating
his thoughts, it was Job’s conception
that his words should be graven in the rock with
an iron pen, or tool, and the interstices afterwards
filled with lead, in order that the contrast
occasioned thereby might render them the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
readily intelligible to those who happened to
travel that way.</p>

<p>Herodotus also mentions a letter engraven on
plates of stone, which Themistocles, the Athenian
general, sent to the Ionians, about five hundred
years before the birth of Christ. Lead, however,
and similar metals being less difficult to write
upon, and more simple and convenient, afterwards
superseded to a great extent the use of such
unwieldy substances as bricks and stone. And
subsequently we find others of a still more pliable
texture employed, such as the skins of animals,
bark, wood, and the leaves of trees. Solomon,
for instance, in the Book of Proverbs, in allusion
to the practice of writing upon thin slices of wood,
advises his son to write his precepts upon the
<em>tables</em> of his heart. And the prophet Habakkuk
was commanded to write a vision and make it
plain upon <em>tables</em>, that he may run that readeth
it. Solomon, as you are aware, lived a thousand
years, and Habakkuk about six hundred and twenty
six, before the Christian era. At a later period,
Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, when
enquired of as to what he would have his child
called, asked, we are told, for “a <em>writing table</em>,
and wrote, saying, his name is John.” Amongst
the Romans, it was customary for the public
affairs of every year to be committed to writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
by the high priest, and published on a table;
such tables being exposed to view, either in their
market-places or temples, in order that the people
might have an opportunity of becoming acquainted
with their contents.</p>

<p>At an early period in their history, both Greeks
and Romans appear to have commonly used either
those plain wooden boards, or boards covered
with wax. It is probable, that at first the tables
were written upon just as they were planed,
and that the overlaying them with wax was an
improvement on that invention. A very decided
advantage being thus obtained, in the facility
afforded for erasing any inaccuracies that might
have occurred, and consequently of correcting
the manuscript. The practice of writing upon
tablets of one kind or another, appears not
to have been entirely laid aside, until the commencement
of the fourteenth century; and, indeed,
even in our day, tablet books of ivory are
occasionally used, for writing upon with black lead
pencils.</p>

<p>The use of <em>boards</em> was in some measure superseded
by that of the leaves of palm, olive, poplar,
and other trees. And, although in Europe, all
these disappeared upon the introduction of the
papyrus and parchments, in some countries the
use of them remains even to this day. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
a record of this old custom may still be found in
the word <em>leaf</em>, which we continue to apply to
sheets of paper, when sewed up into the form of
a book. According to the account of Pliny, the
Egyptians were the first to use the palm leaf, and
books written on it are still preserved in the
East India Museum, as also in the Library of the
British Museum.</p>

<p>The mode of preparation, after cutting into
strips of the length and width required, is
simply to soak them for a short time in boiling
water, after which they are rubbed backwards
and forwards over a smooth piece of wood to
make them pliable, and then carefully dried.
The letters or characters being written or rather
engraved thereon with an iron style, which, piercing
the outside covering, makes indelible letters;
and by afterwards rubbing the writing over with
some dark coloured substance, such as soot or
charcoal, the parts etched or scratched, have
greater relief imparted to them: and the writing
is more easily read.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding many paper mills have been
erected in India, the natives, I understand, frequently
prefer this method, not only for the
ordinary purposes of correspondence and accounts,
but even in some quarters for government documents
of importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>I must here express my sense of the kind assistance
which has on several occasions been
afforded me by the Rev. Benjamin Bailey, late of
Cottyam, Allepie, Madras, who has not only given
to the world a translation in Malayalim of the
entire Bible, but has also compiled two voluminous
dictionaries, for rendering assistance in the study
of that language. This gentleman has recently
afforded me an opportunity of inspecting many
great curiosities of the kind: indeed, before me is
now lying a very neat little specimen written in
Malayalim by him (St. Paul’s Second Epistle to
Timothy), which shows, in a remarkable degree,
the astonishing distinctness which may be produced
by this singular mode of writing.</p>

<p>The style with which the letters are engraven
upon the leaf is usually worn in the
girdle as a prominent ornament of dress. The
case which protects it containing also a small
knife, employed in preparing the slips, and
likewise a little instrument which is used for
piercing the leaves, in order that cords may be
passed through them for the purpose of securing
the manuscript, as may be seen in the instance
of various documents both in the East India
Company’s Museum, and also in the Library of
the British Museum.</p>

<p>A work which I possess, termed the <em>Kammavakyam</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
written in the Pali language, in Burmese
character, upon palm leaf, is thus secured between
very handsome covers. It is a Catechism
of Sacred Rites, used by the Buddhist priesthood
in the examination of a candidate for admission
to that order. A translation of it here,
however, would be no more consistent in point of
matter contained, than it would be in reference
to the subject I am treating. Its character and
language throughout are truly humiliating to
human nature.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there are many very
singular documents of the kind, one in particular,
which is written upon 390 leaves, bound, as it were,
in a frame of gilt copper in the form of a tortoise,
screws being passed through the strips instead
of cords, the fastenings, with some addition, representing
the limbs of the animal. And in the East
India Museum may be seen a smaller one, protected
by stout wooden covers, which has been
carved to represent some animal, apparently
a pig. The custom of writing upon leaves of
trees, appears to have given rise to the adoption
also of the interior bark; the outer being seldom
made use of, in consequence of its extreme
coarseness. When employed, it is customarily
folded over, to admit of its being written upon
both sides. The only documents of this kind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
which have come under my notice, have been
Batta manuscripts, from the island of Sumatra.</p>

<p>Before the art of making paper was known to
the Chinese, they appear to have cut pieces of
silk to such sizes as they wished to make their
books, and thereupon painted the letters with
pencils; the silk being first steeped in a kind of
size, to prevent the colour from running. But
such material being liable to decay, various
animal substances were afterwards employed,
as being of a more durable nature. Of course
the skins were principally used, after being
tanned; but their bones, and even entrails, were
also made use of for the like purpose. Thus, in
the “History of Mahomet,” we read that the
Arabians used the shoulder bones of sheep, on
which they carved remarkable events with a knife,
when, after tying them with a string, they hung
those chronicles up in their cabinets. And in the
library of Ptolemy Philadelphus, which is said to
have contained 700,000 volumes, were the works
of Homer, written in golden letters, on the skins
of serpents. I might mention, that the term
volume here, should not be understood in the sense
which it is now customary to receive it, but
in its derivation from the Latin; signifying
simply a roll, which was the most ancient form of
book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Parchment, or the skins of beasts, dressed and
prepared in a manner rendering them fit for
writing upon, appears to have been employed at
a very early period. Diodorus Siculus informs
us, that the Persians of old wrote all their records
on skins; and Herodotus also alludes to sheep
skins, and goat skins, as in general use among
the Ionians about 440 years before the Christian
Era. The word Parchment is a corruption of the
Latin <i lang="la">Pergamena</i>, from <i lang="la">Pergamus</i>, which some
allege to have been the place of its invention.
But it is very probable that in the time of
Eumenes, who was king of Pergamus, (about 200
years before Christ,) the circumstance of increased
consumption merely occasioned the discovery
of a better method of dressing the skins;
from which fact alone, and perhaps with sufficient
reason, the origin of the present term was derived.
Eumenes, about that period, appears to have endeavoured
to form a library at Pergamus, which
should surpass that of Ptolemy Philadelphus at
Alexandria, and in so doing enraged Ptolemy to
that degree, that he immediately prohibited any
further exportation from Egypt, of the papyrus
which by that time was coming into very general
use, and thus effectually put a stop to Eumenes’
emulation in that particular. It may be, however,
that this prohibition was not solely occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
by jealousy, but by Ptolemy’s fearing that his
dominions, which were so much improved in arts,
sciences, and civilization, since the discovery and
adoption of the papyrus, (of which we shall presently
speak), would be again reduced to a state of
ignorance for want of it; the plant sometimes
failing in unfavourable weather, while the supply
invariably proved unequal to the demand. The
people of Pergamus, therefore, were obliged to
devise other means, and the improved manufacture
of parchment would seem to have been the
result. But, that Eumenes on this occasion invented
the art of making parchment is exceedingly
dubious; for in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and other parts of Scripture, we find
mention made of rolls of writing: in all probability
rolls of parchment.</p>

<p>The manner of reading such rolls may be
gathered from a passage extracted from Hartley’s
“Travels in Greece,” which serves also to elucidate
the peculiar scriptural expression of their
being “written within and without.” You began,
(says he) to read by unfolding, and you continued
to read and to unfold, till, at last, you arrived at
the stick to which the roll was attached; then
you turned the parchment round, and continued
to read on the other side of the roll,
folding it gradually up until you completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the writing, thus were they “written within and
without.”</p>

<p>Papyrus, from which the term paper was
derived, is the name of a celebrated plant,
once extensively used by the Egyptians for
making various articles of utility, such as baskets,
shoes, cordage, and the like. Some writers
state that of this plant the little ark was made,
in which the parents of Moses exposed him upon
the banks of the Nile, and of this it was that the
most ancient paper was manufactured. Not as
would now be customary, by first reducing it to a
pulp, nor, indeed, in any way as resembling modern
paper, except that in both, vegetable fibre is
the basis. That a plant once so useful, and for ages
in Egypt so commercially valuable, should have
totally disappeared, being altogether unknown to
modern botanists, appears scarcely credible; yet
so it is. For the ancient descriptions of the
papyrus, as a flag or bulrush, with a triangular
stem that could barely be spanned, and which
grew to the height of ten feet, or even considerably
more, in the immense marshes occupying a
large part of the surface of lower Egypt; a
leafless wood, as it were, or as one writer describes
it, a forest without branches, the bare stem being
surmounted only by a head of long, thin, straight
fibres, is certainly quite irreconcilable with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
nature of the plant which now bears that name,
and of which one of the stoutest growth has been
very kindly furnished me by Sir W. J. Hooker,
from the Royal Gardens at Kew.</p>

<p>In the prophecy of Isaiah a very remarkable
prediction occurs with reference to this plant.
“The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of
the brooks, and everything sown by the brooks,
shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.”
Doubtless, we may believe that this prophecy
has literally received its fulfilment.</p>

<p>With reference to the mode in which the paper
was manufactured from this plant, two distinct
opinions have been handed down to us. One, that
the epidermis being removed, the spongy part was
cut into thin slices, which were steeped in the
waters of the Nile, or in water slightly imbued
with gum; after which two layers were placed one
above another, carefully arranged in contrary directions,
that is, lengthwise and breadthwise,
which, after being dried, were finally smoothed
and brought to a fit surface for receiving writing,
by being rubbed with a tooth or piece of polished
ivory.</p>

<p>Another method said to have been adopted
in preparing this material, was simply that
of separating the thin concentric coats, or
pellicles of the plant which surrounded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
stock, by means of a needle or pointed shell (on
an average about twenty from each stalk), and
afterwards extending them longitudinally side by
side on a table, a similar layer being placed
across them at right angles; in which state they
were moistened with water, and while wet put
under pressure, being afterwards exposed to the
rays of the sun, and finally polished as in the
former case, with some hard substance, such as
a tooth or shell, not merely for the purpose of
improving the surface, but to prevent its absorbing
the ink. The saccharine matter with which
the whole juice of the plant is said to have been
impregnated, being usually sufficient to cause the
adhesion of the strips together.</p>

<p>So great was the importance of this manufacture
at some periods, that Gibbon informs us of
one Firmus, who raised the standard of revolt in
Egypt against the Emperor Aurelian; that he
boasted he would maintain an army solely from
the profits of his paper trade. At another time,
in the reign of Tiberius, there happened such a
scarcity of paper, from causes that are not mentioned,
that the Senate, in order to prevent a riot,
were obliged to appoint commissioners to distribute
paper to the applicants according to their
respective demands.</p>

<p>Papyri vary much more in length than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
breadth, and upon this fact I would dwell, as
decidedly favouring the conception that the outer
coat merely was employed in preparing the
writing material. Indeed, in every specimen
which I have examined, I have found the slips of
which it is composed rarely exceeding twelve
or fifteen inches even lengthwise. Whereas, if
they had been produced from the pithy part of
the stem, after being cut into slices, there would
have been no difficulty whatever in manufacturing
the paper of the entire length, which, as I have
already stated, sometimes exceeded ten feet.</p>

<p>The breadth of papyri seldom exceeds eighteen
inches, sometimes they are not more than four
inches in width, which I imagine to have been
determined by the length of the outer coats or
pellicles taken from the plant; the length, of
course, being carried to any extent, simply by
fastening one sheet to another. The largest
specimen of which I have heard is one at Paris,
measuring thirty feet in length. The most interesting
which we possess in this country is one
which may be seen in the Manuscript Department
of the British Museum, which appears to
have been written in Latin in the year 572, upon
a roll of papyrus, eight feet and a half long, and
twelve inches wide. It is a deed relating to the
sale of a house and land at Ravenna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Though papyri found on mummies are often
in a good state of preservation, it is necessary to
be very careful in handling them. The roll,
owing to its being pressed under the swathings
of the mummy, being completely flattened, and
from the unvarying high temperature of the tomb
to which it has for so long a time been subjected,
is frequently so dry and brittle, that if any
attempt be made to unroll it without previous
precaution, small pieces will continually fall off.
Still, the durability of this writing material is
one of its best qualities. It can, in some instances,
be rolled and unrolled after the lapse of many
centuries without any detriment to it; but the
complete preservation of such specimens is generally
to be attributed to their being kept from the
air either in wooden or earthen vessels, frequently
in the interior of the Idol to which the
mummy was once wont to present his offering,
which is usually of some grotesque, or even
hideous form, altogether unworthy of mention as
representing any created thing, either upon the
face of the earth, or in the waters beneath. Not
long since I was shown one, containing a roll of
papyrus, which had been roughly carved out of
wood, somewhat resembling an overgrown <em>cat</em> in
a sitting posture. And this so called god, as
appears to have been customarily the case, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
taken from the tomb, where it stood over the
mummy, with two very beautiful vases, which at
one time contained fragrant oils, believed to be
acceptable to the Idol, placed in front. The
papyri thus curiously preserved, usually contain
an account of the rank or station which the
dead once filled, and occasionally some description
of the particular rites and ceremonies
observed with reference to the worship.</p>

<p>With respect to the period at which the
ancients began to make a writing substance of
the papyrus, or, indeed, of the name of the originator,
nothing decisive is known. It would,
however, appear from the prophecy in Isaiah,
which has been already referred to, in which
mention is made of paper reeds by the brooks,
that paper made of such reeds was actually in
use when that prophecy was written. And in
accordance with this conception, the learned Dr.
Gill, in his commentary says, “On the banks of
the Nile grew a reed, or rush, called by the
Greeks papyrus, or byblus, from whence come
the words paper and bible, or book, of which
paper was anciently made, even as early as
the time of Isaiah,” now nearly 3000 years
ago.</p>

<p>The kind of pen ordinarily used for writing
upon this material was simply <em>a reed</em>, cut and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
split just as our quill pens at present are, but
with a point not quite so sharp.</p>

<p>I have in my possession some very fine specimens
of what is usually called Bark Cloth,
which, in its manufacture, approximates more
nearly to that of modern paper than any other
substance with which I am acquainted. It is
formed from the bark of a small tree, or shrub,
called the Paper Mulberry (<i>morus papyrifera</i>),
which grows wild in the southern provinces
of China, in Ava, in the Burmese country,
and in India, as well as in all the Asiatic
and Polynesian islands from Japan to Otaheite.
If a strip of this bark, which is remarkable for
the fineness of its texture, after being soaked
in water, be laid on a smooth stone, and then
carefully beaten with a bat or mallet, the surface
of which is cut into fine ribs, the fibres will become
separated more or less from one another,
and if the beating be carefully conducted, the bark
will ultimately assume the appearance of a web
of fine linen, two pieces of bark being made to
incorporate with one another simply by laying
them so as to overlap a little, and then beating
again. In this simple way the material is
formed; and by a short exposure to the sunshine
when wet, becomes perfectly white. To
render it fit for writing, it is afterwards polished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in a manner similar to the papyrus, by
rubbing it with a shell or other hard substance
until it has very much the appearance of parchment;
and that it bears ink perfectly well, may
be seen by an inspection of some Javanese
Works, which are contained in the library of the
Hon. East India Company.</p>

<p>The bat or mallet employed by the natives in
preparing this material is usually about 15 inches
in length, and from two and a half to three inches
square, one side being grooved very coarsely,
another somewhat finer, a third exceedingly fine,
and the fourth generally cut in chequers or small
squares. The bark is first beaten with the
coarsest side of the instrument, and then, in turn,
with those parts which are finer, the resinous
matter contained in it being usually found sufficiently
adhesive.</p>

<p>Without, however, dwelling longer upon this
portion of our subject, which time will not permit,
let us now proceed to trace out, in some
measure, the history and progress of that more
perfect and ingenious invention, <span class="allsmcap">MODERN PAPER</span>;
and in so doing, I can hardly forbear making
some allusion to the incalculable advantages
which have resulted to mankind from the introduction
of so ingenious and extraordinary
a discovery. It certainly would appear very remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
that not only amongst mankind generally,
but even with those intimately associated
with that branch of commerce, so little interest
should be found to exist in an acquaintance with
its origin and advancement, beyond the bare
knowledge which directly concerns them. It is
true that with them, no less than with people in
general, the very indispensableness of the material
renders familiarity at once an unconscious stumbling-block,
to any conception of the grandeur
of its importance, or its vastly interesting, and
varied associations. Yet what infinite trouble
and labour, what fruitless consumption of time, has
not been saved by the invention of paper. How
many toilsome and dangerous experiments have
not philosophical projectors been spared. What
laborious investigations and study have not thus
been abridged, by the facts of others’ researches
being so conveyed to posterity—knowledge,
more than any one man could have attained to
in a thousand years, though born with faculties
in maturity. To enumerate all the advantages
which the invention of paper has afforded mankind,
it were, indeed, useless to attempt; for,
whether we look at the traveller, traversing sea
and land, without the knowledge of geography,
and navigation; without those beautiful charts of
the ocean, by which he is now enabled to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
with safety, and even to predict with certainty, his
arrival at the most distant ports: or, whether we
look at the man of science, who being neither
artist, nor manufacturer, is thus enabled to communicate
his plans and projects with accuracy
and ease, for mechanics afterwards to improve
and perfect: or, indeed, whether we view the
growing youth, educated with such facility in the
principles of their duty, backward even to barbarous
states, softened and enlightened by means
of the discovery; its value, in the applicability
of its purposes, stands out alike in each, declaring
it distinctly above all other inventions, as truly
the most wonderful, useful, and important, which
has ever yet transpired in any age of the world;
inasmuch, as without it, every other discovery
must necessarily have continued comparatively
useless to society. For, be it remembered, that
in contrasting the results of this invention, with
the productions of former periods, we are, in fact,
arraying in our train, the mighty arm of the
press against the feeble efforts of an unwieldy
style, or the tedious and uncertain process of the
slow-paced pen, which prior to an acquaintance
with the art of printing, were the only means
mankind possessed for spreading the influence
and advantages of learning amongst their fellow-creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
And, again, how highly interesting
is it, to observe the prodigious advancement
resulting from an ingenious and successful application
of machinery in the one case, serving
at the same time to develop to our wonder
and amazement the extraordinary capabilities of
production which have since been revealed by
the Printing Machine. Truly may we now pronounce—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Press! the venerated Press!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Freedom’s impenetrable shield—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sword that wins her best success,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The only sword that man should wield.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is stated that the daily aggregate printed
surface of the <cite>Times</cite> alone, actually exceeds that
of thirty acres, and the <cite>Illustrated London News</cite>,
on one occasion, sent forth no less than 500,000
double numbers, or one million sheets. In
fact, 2000 reams, exceeding seventy tons in
weight.</p>

<p>The manufacture of four or five hundred square
feet of paper per minute, and 12,000 impressions
per hour, are now matters of every day occurrence,
although it should be borne in mind,
that without the <em>paper machine</em>, pouring forth
its miles of web, these corresponding advantages
in printing could not have been developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>We may take as an instance, that book of
books, which Pollok very beautifully describes
as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent18">“The only star</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Although now a handsome copy, printed on tolerably
fine paper, gilt edged, and bound in embossed
roan, may be purchased for one shilling,
in the reign of Henry the Third, it is recorded
that two arches of London Bridge were built for
a less sum than that for which a Bible could be
procured. And, as we continue the search still
further back, the contrast becomes increasingly
interesting. For let it be remembered, that the
sixty-six books of which the Bible is composed,
were not always contained in so convenient a
form. During the sixteen centuries which were
occupied in making known this revelation to
man, not only were the advantages which we
possess altogether unknown, even in their
rudest form, but substitutes, apparently far less
promising than many we have referred to, were
also at one period and another directed to be
employed. As for instance, to Ezekiel, Jehovah
once said, “Thou also son of man, take thee a <em>tile</em>,
and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the
city, even Jerusalem.” And elsewhere, “Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
thou son of man, take thee one <em>stick</em>, and
write upon it, for Judah, and for the children of
Israel, his companions.”</p>

<p>Of course there have been occasions when certain
portions of the Scriptures were very beautifully
inscribed (more particularly of the New
Testament) sometimes in letters of gold, on parchment
of the richest purple. Still they were <em>manuscript</em>,
and as such, not unfrequently occupied the
labour of individuals for years. Instances are
upon record, of fifty years in the life of one man
being engaged in the execution of a single copy of
the Scriptures. In the present day it is, perhaps,
impossible for us properly to appreciate the skill,
the labour, and the immense expenditure employed
in such productions.</p>

<p>For now, by the aid of the printing machine, we
have an entire copy struck off in the space of one
minute; and such were the almost miraculous
efforts of the British and Foreign Bible Society
last year, that they actually issued, in nearly 150
known languages, an average circulation of a copy
for every minute throughout the year.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that in tracing
the origin of so curious an art as that of the manufacture
of modern paper, any definite conclusion
as to the precise time or period of its adoption
should hitherto have proved altogether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
unattainable. The Royal Society of Sciences at
Gottingen, in 1755 and 1763, offered considerable
premiums for that especial object, but unfortunately
all researches, however directed, were
utterly fruitless. The most ancient manuscript
on <em>cotton paper</em> appears to have been written in
1050, while Eustathius, who wrote towards the
end of the 12th century, states that the Egyptian
papyrus had gone into disuse but a little before his
time. To reconcile, however, in some measure
contradictory accounts, it may be observed, that
on some particular occasions, and by some particular
persons, the Egyptian paper might have
been employed for several hundred years after
it ceased to be in general use, and it is quite certain,
that although the new invention must have
proved of great advantage to mankind, it could
only have been introduced by degrees. Amongst
the records which are preserved at the Tower
of London I have seen a letter addressed to
Henry the Third, and written previously to
1222, which appears to be upon strong paper,
of mixed materials. Several letters of the following
reign, which are there preserved, are
evidently written on <em>cotton</em> paper. Were we able
to determine the precise time when paper was
first made from cotton, we should also be enabled
to fix the invention of the art of paper making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
as it is now practised. For the application of
cotton to the purposes of paper making, requires
almost as much labour and ingenuity as the use
of linen rags. Some have conceived, and I think
with sufficient reason, that China originally gave
birth to the invention. Certain it is, that the art
of making paper from vegetable matter reduced
to pulp was known and understood there long
before it was practised in Europe, which did not
take place until the 11th century, and the Chinese
have carried it to a high degree of perfection.
Several kinds of their paper evince the
greatest art and ingenuity, and are applied with
much advantage to many purposes. One especially,
manufactured from the inner bark of the
bamboo, is particularly celebrated for affording
the clearest and most delicate impressions from
copper plates, which we ordinarily term <em>india
proofs</em>. The Chinese, however, make paper of
various kinds, some of the bark of trees, especially
the mulberry tree, and the elm, but chiefly
of the bamboo and cotton tree, and occasionally
from other substances, such as hemp, wheat, or
rice straw. To give an idea of the manner of
fabricating paper from these different substances,
it will suffice, (the process being nearly the same
in each,) to confine our observations to the method
adopted in the manufacture of paper from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the bamboo,—a kind of cane or hollow reed,
divided by knots, but larger, more elastic, and
more durable than any other reed. The whole
substance of the bamboo is at times employed
by the Chinese in this operation, but
the younger stalks are preferred. The canes
being first cut into pieces of four or five feet in
length, are made into parcels, and thrown into a
reservoir of mud and water for about a fortnight,
to soften them; they are then taken out, and
carefully washed, every one of the pieces being
again cut into filaments, which are exposed to
the rays of the sun to dry, and to bleach. After
this they are boiled in large kettles, and then
reduced to pulp in mortars, by means of a hammer
with a long handle; or as is more commonly
the case, by submitting the mass to the action of
stampers, raised in the usual way by cogs on
a revolving axis. The pulp being thus far prepared,
a glutinous substance, extracted from
the shoots of a certain plant, is next mixed
with it in stated quantities, and upon this mixture
chiefly depends the quality of the paper.
As soon as this has taken place the whole is again
beaten together until it becomes a thick viscous
liquor, which, after being reduced to an essential
state of consistency, by a further admixture of
water, is then transferred to a large reservoir or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
vat, having on each side of it a drying stove, in
the form of the ridge of a house, that is, consisting
of two sloping sides touching at top. These
sides are covered externally with an exceedingly
smooth coating of stucco, and a flue passes
through the brickwork, so as to keep the whole
of each side equally and moderately warm. A
vat and a stove are placed alternately in the manufactory,
so that there are two sides of two
different stoves adjacent to each vat. The workman
dips his mould, which is sometimes formed
merely of bulrushes, cut in narrow strips, and
mounted in a frame, into the vat, and then raises
it out again, the water passing off through the
perforations in the bottom, and the pulpy paper-stuff
remaining on its surface. The frame of the
mould is then removed, and the bottom is pressed
against the side of one of the stoves, so as to
make the sheet of paper adhere to its surface,
and allow the sieve, (as it were) to be withdrawn.
The moisture, of course, speedily evaporates by
the warmth of the stove, but before the paper is
quite dry, it is brushed over on its outer surface
with a size made of rice, which also soon dries,
and the paper is then stripped off in a finished
state, having one surface exquisitely smooth,
it being seldom the practice of the Chinese
to write or print on both sides of the paper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
While all this is taking place, the moulder has
made a second sheet, and pressed it against the
side of the other stove, where it undergoes the
operation of sizing and drying, precisely as in the
former case.</p>

<p>The very delicate material, which is brought
from China in pieces only a few inches square,
and commonly, but erroneously, termed <em>rice
paper</em>, is in reality but a membrane of the breadfruit
tree, obtained by cutting the stem spirally
round the axis, and afterwards flattening it by
pressure. That it is not an artificial production
may very readily be perceived by contrasting
one of the more translucent specimens with a
piece of the finest manufactured paper, by the
aid of the microscope.</p>

<p>The precise period at which the manufacture
of paper was first introduced into Europe appears
to be rather a matter of uncertainty. Paper mills,
moved by water power, were in operation
in Tuscany at the commencement of the fourteenth
century; and at Nuremberg, in Germany,
one was established in 1390, by Ulman Stromer,
who wrote the first work ever published on the
art of paper making. He seems to have employed
a great number of persons, all of whom
were obliged to take an oath that they would not
teach any one the art of paper making, or make it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
on their own account. In the following year, when
anxious to increase the means of its production,
he met with such strong opposition from those he
employed, who would not consent to any enlargement
of the mill, that it became at length requisite
to bring them before the magistrates, by whom
they were imprisoned, after which they submitted,
by renewing their oaths. Two or three centuries
later, we find the Dutch in like manner, so extremely
jealous with respect to the manufacture,
as to prohibit the exportation of moulds, under
no less severe a penalty than that of death.</p>

<p>Fuller makes some exceedingly curious observations
respecting the paper of his time, which
may, perhaps, be introduced here with advantage.
He says—“Paper participates in some sort of
the character of the country which makes it; the
Venetian being neat, subtile, and court like; the
French light, slight, and slender; and the Dutch
thick, corpulent, and gross, sucking up the ink
with the sponginess thereof.” He complains
that the paper manufactories were not then sufficiently
encouraged, considering the vast sums of
money expended in our land for paper out of
Italy, France, and Germany, which might be lessened,
were it made in our nation. “To such
who object,” says he, “that we can never equal
the perfection of Venice paper, I return, neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
can we match the purity of Venice glasses, and
yet many green ones are blown in Sussex, profitable
to the makers, and convenient to the users,
our home-spun paper might be found beneficial.”</p>

<p>With reference to any particular <em>time</em> or <em>place</em>
at which this inestimable invention was first
adopted in England, all researches into existing
records contribute little to our assistance. The
first paper mill erected here is commonly attributed
to Sir John Spielman, a German, who established
one in 1588, at Dartford, for which the
honour of knighthood was afterwards conferred
upon him by Queen Elizabeth, who was also
pleased to grant him a license “for the sole
gathering for ten years of all rags, &amp;c., necessary
for the making of such paper.” It is, however,
quite certain that paper mills were in existence
here long before Spielman’s time. <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Shakespeare'">
Shakspeare</ins>, in the second part of his play of Henry the Sixth,
the plot of which appears laid at least a century
previously, refers to a paper mill. In fact, he
introduces it as an additional weight to the
charge which Jack Cade is made to bring against
<ins class="corr" id="tn-35a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Lord Say'">
Lord Saye</ins>, “Thou hast most traitorously corrupted,”
says he, “the youth of the realm, in
erecting a grammar school, and whereas, before,
our forefathers had no other books but the score
and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
used, and contrary to the king, his crown and
dignity, thou hast built a paper mill.”</p>

<p>Understanding that some five-and-thirty or
forty years since it was asserted by the then
occupier of North Newton mill, near Banbury,
in Oxfordshire, which at that time was the property
of Lord Saye and Sele, that such was the
first erected in this country for the manufacture
of paper, and also that it was to that mill Shakspeare
referred in the passage just quoted, I
recently communicated with Lord Saye and Sele
as to the plausibility of the supposition; remarking
at the same time as I would now, that
although it was of course quite impossible to
award the immortal bard great credit for chronological
accuracy, it must, I thought, be admitted,
that so marvellous an invention, unless really in
existence, could not by any possibility of conception
have been conjured up even to supply the
unlimited necessities of the poet’s strain. His
Lordship, however, at once terminated the probability
of this mill taking the precedence, even
of Sir John Spielman’s, by informing me that the
first nobleman succeeding to that title who had
property in Oxfordshire, which he acquired by
marriage, was the <em>son</em> of the <ins class="corr" id="tn-36" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'first Lord Say'">
first Lord Saye</ins>, to whom Shakspeare makes reference.</p>

<p>The earliest trace of the manufacture in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
country occurs in a book printed by Caxton,
about the year 1490, in which it is said of John
Tate—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Which late hathe in England doo make thys paper thynne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That now in our Englyssh thys booke is prynted inne.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His mill was situate at or near Stevenage,
in Hertfordshire, and that it was considered
worthy of especial notice is evident from an
entry made in Henry the Seventh’s Household
Book, on the 25th of May, 1498—“For a rewarde
geven at the paper-mylne, 16s. 8d.” And
again in 1499—“Geven in rewarde to Tate of
the mylne, 6s. 8d.”</p>

<p>Still, it appears to me far less probable that
Shakspeare alluded to this mill, although established
at a period corresponding in many respects
with that of occurrences referred to in
connection, than to that of Sir John Spielman’s,
which, standing as it did in the immediate
neighbourhood of Jack Cade’s rebellion, and
being esteemed so important at the time, as to
call forth the marked patronage of Queen Elizabeth;
while the extent of the operations carried
on there, if we may judge from the remarks of a
poet of the time, were equally calculated to arouse
undivided national interest; one can hardly help
thinking, that the prominence to which Shakspeare
assigns the existence of a paper mill, coupled as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
such allusion is with an acknowledged liberty, inherent
in him, of transposing events, to add force
to his style, as also with very considerable doubt
as to the exact year in which he wrote the play,
that the reference made was to none other than
that of Sir John Spielman’s establishment of
1588, concerning which we find it said—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Six hundred men are set to work by him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That else might starve or seek abroad their bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who now live well, and go full brave and trim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And who may boast they are with paper fed.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Be the introduction or establishment of the
invention, so far as this country is concerned,
when it may; little progress appears to have resulted
therefrom, even so late as the middle of
the 17th century. In 1695, a company was
formed in Scotland “for manufacturing white
writing and printing paper,” relating to which,
“Articles concluded and agreed upon at a general
meeting at Edinburgh, the 19th day of August,”
in the same year, may still be seen by those who
are sufficiently curious, in the Library of the
British Museum. It is also recorded in the
Craftsman (910), that William the Third granted
the Huguenots refuged in England a patent for
establishing paper manufactories, and that Parliament
likewise granted to them other privileges,
amongst which, in all probability, that very unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
practice of putting up each ream
with two quires composed entirely of sheets
spoiled in course of production. Their undertaking,
however, like that of many others, appears
to have met with very little success.</p>

<p>In fact, the making of paper here scarcely
reached any high degree of perfection until about
1760-5, at which period the celebrated James
Whatman established his reputation at Maidstone.</p>

<p>The report of the Juries of the Great Exhibition
of 1851—a work from whence information
might very naturally be sought, and which
one would have supposed to be unexceptionable
in point of authenticity,—contains, I regret to say,
a very unfortunate misstatement with reference
to the position of Mr. Whatman at that time. It
is there stated that he gained his knowledge of
the manufacture prior to establishing these well-known
mills “by working as a journeyman in
most of the principal paper manufactories of the
Continent,” which is altogether an erroneous assertion;
for Mr. Whatman previously to his being
engaged as a manufacturer, was an officer in the
Kent Militia, and acquired the information, which
eventually rendered him so successful, by travelling
in the suite of the British Ambassador to
Holland, where the best papers were then made,
and the insight thus obtained enabled his genius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
to effect the great improvements afterwards so
universally admitted.</p>

<p>At the present time, Whatman’s papers (so
called) are manufactured at two mills, totally
distinct, both of which are still worked by the
descendants of Mr. Whatman’s successors; the
paper in the one case being readily distinguished
by the water-mark, “J. Whatman, Turkey Mill,”
and in the other, by the water-mark simply “J.
Whatman,” but bearing upon the upper wrapper
of each ream the original and well-known stamp,
containing the initials L. V. G., which are those
of L. V. Gerrevink, as celebrated a Dutch manufacturer
prior to Mr. Whatman’s improvements,
as Mr. Whatman’s name has since become
in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>In making so marked an allusion to this particular
manufacture, I am bound, perhaps, to
qualify it in some measure by directing attention
to the comparatively recent application
of continuous or rotatory motion which has,
indeed, effected no more wonderful or extraordinary
results than in the singular conversion of
pulp into paper.</p>

<p>The largest paper now made by hand, which is
termed Antiquarian, measures 53 inches by 31,
and so great is the weight of liquid pulp employed
in the formation of a single sheet, that no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
fewer than nine men are required, besides additional
assistance in raising the mould out of the
vat by means of pulleys; while by the aid of the
<em>paper machine</em>, the most perfect production may
be ensured, of a continuous length, and eight feet
wide, without any positive necessity for personal
superintendence.</p>

<p>The principle of paper making by machinery
is simply this, instead of employing moulds and
felts of limited dimensions, as was originally the
practice, the peculiar merit of the invention consists
in the adaptation of an endless wire-gauze to
receive the paper pulp, and again an endless felt,
to which in progress the paper is transferred;
and thus by a marvellously delicate adjustment,
while the wire at one end receives but a constant
flow of liquid pulp, in the course of two or three
minutes we may have, carefully wound on a roller
at the other extremity, the most beautiful and serviceable
of fabrics. Instead of counting sheets in
course of production as formerly, or even measuring
the length by yards, we may actually have the
paper drawn out as it were, and wound up, miles in
length. In the recent Dublin Exhibition, a sheet
was exhibited which was said to have been of
sufficient length to wrap round the world; but, I
must confess, that I am not in a position to vouch
for the accuracy of the statement. An anecdote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
however, is told, (the truth of which <ins class="corr" id="tn-42" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'I have no no reason to'">
I have no reason to</ins> doubt,) of the patentee of this machine,
and a relative or friend of his, of some
considerable standing and influence in the pottery
district, who were dining together about the period
at which this machine was first adopted;
when the one speaking of the advantages which
he conceived the new mode would prove to his
friend, alluded above all others to the remarkable
capability which it possessed of producing
paper of any length that could possibly be required.
“Well,” said his friend, “I very much
doubt that, but if you can make me <em>five miles</em> of
the quality I require, I shall certainly have little
hesitation in admitting all the perfection and
suitability which you have laboured to impress
upon me.” The very next day the machine was
set to work, and timed, in order to ascertain
the required length wound upon the reel, which,
after being charged with Excise duty, was forwarded
without delay to its destination; and, as
may be conceived, to the utter astonishment of
his incredulous friend.</p>

<p>It is a fact, which certainly deserves to be noticed
for its singularity as well as for the strong
point of view in which it places the merits of this
invention, that an art of such great importance
to society as that of the manufacture of paper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
should have remained for at least eight centuries
since paper is first believed to have been in use,
and that upwards of 200 of those years should
have elapsed since its first introduction into England,
without any mechanical improvement whatever
as regards the processes which were then
employed. It is true, that various attempts from
time to time were made, but in every instance
they appear to have met with very little success.
In France, an ingenious artist contrived
three figures in wood to do the work of the vatman,
the coucher, and the layer; but, after persevering
for six months, and incurring considerable
expense, he was at length compelled to
abandon his scheme. And although paper was
previously manufactured in China, in Persia, and
indeed throughout all Asia, sometimes of considerable
length, I might mention that it was so,
not by machinery, but by means of a mould of
the size of the paper intended to be made, suspended
like a swing, and having men placed at
the distance of about every four feet, for the purpose
of producing an uniform shaking motion,
after the mould had been immersed in the vat,
in order to compact the pulp.</p>

<p>Such then was the rude state of this important
manufacture, even up to the commencement of
the present century, when another ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Frenchman, named Didot, brought over to this
country a small model of a continuous machine,
with the view of getting the benefit of English
capital and mechanical skill to bring it into an
operative state; and fortunately for the vigorous
development of this embryo project, which had
proved an abortion in France, he communicated
his ideas of the practicability of the measure to
a mercantile firm of considerable opulence, who,
with great public spirit, at once concluded an
agreement with him for the purchase of a principle
which might be said at that period never to
have been tried. The firm alluded to was that
of the Messrs. Fourdrinier, who at that time, and
for several years afterwards, were the principal
stationers and paper manufacturers in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish the arduous object which
those gentlemen then had in view, they appear
to have laboured without intermission for nearly
six years, when, after incurring an expense which
would have exhausted any fortune of moderate
extent (upwards of £60,000), they at length succeeded
in giving some sort of organization and
connection to the mechanical parts, for which
they obtained a patent, and finding eventually
that there was little prospect of being recompensed
for labour and risk, or even reimbursed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
their expenses, unless Parliament should think
proper to grant an extension of their patent,
they determined upon making a fresh application
to the Legislature for that purpose. But, it
would appear that although in the Bill as it passed
the House of Commons, such prolonged period
extended to fourteen years; in the Lords it was
limited to seven, with an understanding that such
term should be extended to seven years more in
the event of the patentees proving, upon a future
application, that they had not been sufficiently
remunerated. No such application, however, was
made, in consequence of a Standing Order of the
House of Lords, placed on their journal subsequently
to the passing of the said act; which regulation
had the effect of depriving the Messrs.
Fourdrinier of any benefit whatever from the
invention; and ultimately, so great were the difficulties
they had to encounter, and so little encouragement
or support did they receive, that the
time and attention required to mature this valuable
invention, and the large capital which it absorbed,
were the means of reducing that wealthy
and liberal firm to the humiliating condition of
bankruptcy; and only within the past few months
the surviving partner, Mr. Henry Fourdrinier, to
whom mainly we owe the success of the invention,
and as unquestionably our present high position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
in the scale of nations, was carried to his
grave, in his ninetieth year, comparatively a beggar.
A leading article in the <cite>Times</cite>, June 17,
1847, speaking of Mr. Henry Fourdrinier, thus
concludes by advocating his claims:—“Three
days only are past since an assembly, illustrious
for rank and station, met to celebrate and immortalize
the memory of Caxton. What more
fitting or graceful opportunity of paying a tribute
of respect and justice to his fellow-labourer
in an adjoining field? the one the father of
printing, the other the inventor of a process by
which the full benefits of printing have been
realized to the civilized world. And in the case
of Mr. Fourdrinier this advantage is found, that
he can receive in person the tribute of a nation’s
gratitude; an octogenarian, he still lives; unlike
Caxton, he is not yet a subject for posthumous
honours. It is not a monument he wants,
but justice. The world, no doubt, according to
ancient precedent, would rather pay its tribute
of admiration, if we should not rather say its
debt of homage, after death. But it is fortunately
in the power of the present age to point to a modern
example of tardy but full reparation made
to a living man, a great improvement upon the
old rule, the mockery of a national funeral, and
Westminster Abbey. Lord Dundonald’s case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
will always stand as a brilliant exception to the
common neglect of contemporary merit, and by
his side it would be well to place, at no great
interval, the man who in a humbler sphere, but
better suited to an age of peace, has benefitted
humanity by facilitating the diffusion of letters,
and the acquisition of knowledge.” Powerful
and influential as is that journal, however, this
worthy man was still left to combat <ins class="corr" id="tn-47" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'so bitter a a reverse'">
so bitter a reverse</ins>, without even the means of procuring
comfort in his declining years.</p>

<p>But I am happy to say that an appeal has
lately been made to that particular branch of
trade so materially benefitted by the invention,
the paper manufacturers, in the hope that thus
a sufficient fund may be raised to furnish his
surviving daughters with a competent annuity
for the remainder of their days. And I sincerely
hope that the results of this laudable effort may
speedily prove to be as worthy the spirit of its
originators, as on the part of the public generally
it deserves consideration, as being supremely a
national duty. For, be it remembered, that
while the value and importance of such an invention
to the paper maker is sufficiently clear and
conclusive, from the fact of its general adoption
throughout the united kingdom, by no less than
700 manufacturers (averaging, probably, twice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
that number of machines); so on the other hand,
we surely cannot remain unmindful of its effects
and benefits upon ourselves, when in contrasting
the results of the paper-making-machine with the
productions of a former period, we find the cost
reduced to the consumer considerably more than
one-half, in some instances to actually a fourth.</p>

<p>Thus then, it will be seen that as civilization
has advanced, the facilities for recording and
transmitting facts have uniformly improved and
multiplied until now, instead of oral tradition,
necessarily uncertain; instead of the bark and
leaf, perishable or fragile; instead of the papyrus,
so brittle; the parchment, so costly; the raw
cotton paper, so expensive; instead of inscriptions
by the unwieldy style and by the slow-paced
pen, we have now a cheap, serviceable
material, manufactured from the most useless of
fabrics, and even from the very refuse of our
clothing, which, conjointly with that art which
preserves all other arts, enables us far to surpass
in recording and transmitting power, even the
greatest demands in the world’s history.</p>

<p>In the present chapter it will be my object to
take as general a glance at the principles of paper
making, as in the former it was my endeavour
to treat its history.</p>

<p>First then, we have to notice the nature of some
of the materials employed. And although everybody
is supposed to know that paper is made
from rags, it may, perhaps, be excuseable to consider
of what the rags themselves originally were
composed. Unquestionably, the simplest definition
one could give would be, fragments of worn-out
clothing; and by clothing, no doubt, we all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
sufficiently understand the dress, vesture or garments
usually adopted by man. Still we have
to ask ourselves of what are these articles of clothing
composed? It has been somewhat shrewdly
remarked in every instance, of a something of
which man has previously denuded something
else. At one time (as we all know) he cunningly
entraps innumerable individuals, of the fox,
weazel, and squirrel tribes, to strip them of their
warm and valuable fur. At another, he hatches
and feeds legions of caterpillars, that he may
rob them of the defensive padding which they
spin to protect their helplessness while passing
through the chrysalis state. Sometimes he
pastures the sheep for its skin and its wool,
occasionally setting so little store by the carcase
as to melt it into tallow, or burn it as fuel.
And even mother earth herself is treated with
no greater forbearance, by alternately feeding
her up with manure, and teazing and tormenting
her surface with tillage, she is coaxed and compelled
to send forth a living vegetable down,
which is shorn, plucked and plundered from her
bosom, in the shape of cotton, flax, and hemp.</p>

<p>And all those silks, woollens, flax, hemp, and
cotton, in all their varied forms, whether as cambric,
lace, linen, holland, fustian, corduroy, bagging,
canvas, or even as cables, are or can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
used in the manufacture of paper of one kind or
another. Still, when we speak of rags, as of
necessity, they accumulate, and are gathered up
by those who make it their business to collect
them, they are very far from answering the
purposes of paper making. Rags, to the
paper-maker, are almost as various in point of
quality or distinction, as the materials which
are sought after through the influence of fashion.
Thus, the paper maker, in buying rags, requires
to know exactly of what the bulk is composed.
If he is a manufacturer of white papers, no matter
whether intended for writing or printing,
silk or woollen rags, would be found altogether
useless, inasmuch, as is well known, the bleach
will fail to act upon any animal substance whatever.
And although he may purchase even a
mixture in proper proportions adapted for the
quality he is in the habit of supplying, it is as
essential in the processes of preparation, that
they shall be previously separated. Cotton in
its raw state, as may be readily conceived, requires
far less preparation than a strong hempen
fabric, and thus, to meet the requirements of the
paper-maker, we have rags classed under different
denominations, as for instance, besides <em>Fines</em> and
<em>Seconds</em>, we have <em>Thirds</em>, which are composed of
fustians, corduroy, and similar fabrics; <em>Stamps</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
or <em>Prints</em> (as they are termed by the paper-maker),
which are coloured rags, and also innumerable
foreign rags, distinguished by certain
well-known marks, indicating their various peculiarities.
I might mention, however, that although
by far the greater portion of the materials
employed are such as we have already alluded
to, it is not from their possessing any exclusive
suitableness—since various fibrous vegetable
substances have frequently been used, and are
indeed still successfully employed—but rather
on account of their comparatively trifling value,
arising from the limited use to which they are
otherwise applicable. The agitation of late, which
was partly-occasioned by the war, and partly by
a sudden and unprecedented demand, that there
was a great scarcity of fibrous materials fit to be
used in paper making, coupled with an advance
in the price of at least twenty per cent., and still
further heightened by the offer of £1,000 to any
one who could procure an advantageous substitute,
has necessarily called forth many suggestions,
but, to quote the words of Dr. Forbes Royle,
“The generality of modern experimentalists
seem to be wholly unacquainted with the labours
of their predecessors, many of them commencing
improvement by repeating experiments which
had already been made, and announcing results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
as new, which had long previously been ascertained.”
The latest suggestion of the kind, and
indeed the only one worth referring to, is that
which Lord Derby recently brought forward in the
House of Lords. He first referred to a Bill before
the other House of Parliament for incorporating a
company established for the manufacture of paper
from <em>flax straw</em>. Of course there is little new in
this. The rags or materials already employed,
are composed, as everybody knows, to a very
great extent, of the fibre of flax, and besides,
possess this great advantage, that they have
been repeatedly prepared for paper making by
the numerous alkaline washings which they
necessarily receive during their period of use,
which, if left to the paper-maker, as would be
the case with flax in its raw state, to be done all
at once, (and it must <em>be</em> done before the fibre
is fit for use,) would add so fearfully to the
expense, as to render its adoption for printing
or writing paper altogether unadvisable. However,
Lord Derby proceeds—“It was proposed
to employ the fibres of various plants indigenous
to the West Indies, such as the plantain,
the aloe, and others, which grow in vast
abundance, and which were utterly valueless at
the present moment. He need not say, that an
immense abundance of this material could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
produced; and he wished only to mention, that
on one estate in Demerara no less than 160,000
plantain trees were cut down every year, the
trees going to waste, as they were cut down only
for the purpose of getting at the fruit; and this
wasted material contained 250 tons of fibre, capable
of being manufactured into paper.”</p>

<p>Now, admitting <em>all</em> this, which Lord Derby is
<em>reported</em> to have said, I can again assert that there
is nothing whatever new in it. I have specimens
of paper from the same materials, which were
made several years ago. The cost, however,
of reducing the plantain into fibre, coupled
with the expense of freight, was found, and will
still be found, to bring up the price so much, as
to effectually exclude it from the manufacture of
paper; for this simple reason, that rags, of necessity,
must continue accumulating, and before it will
answer the purpose of the paper-maker to employ
new material—which is not so well adapted
for his purpose as the old—he must be enabled
to purchase it for considerably less than it would
be worth in the manufacture of textile fabrics.</p>

<p>All that can be said as to the suitableness of
fibre in general may be summed up in very few
words; any vegetable fibre having a corrugated
edge, which will enable it to cohere in the mass,
is fit for the purposes of paper making; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
extent to which such might be applied can solely
be determined by the question of cost in its production;
and hitherto, everything proposed has
been excluded, as in the case of the <em>plantain</em> or
<em>banana</em>, either by the cost of freight, the cost of
preparation, or the expenses combined.</p>

<p>To convey some idea of the number of substances
which have been really tried; in the Library
of the British Museum may be seen a book,
printed in low Dutch, containing upwards of sixty
specimens of paper, made of different materials,
the result of one man’s experiments <em>alone</em>, so
far back as the year 1772. In fact, almost every
species of tough fibrous vegetable, and even animal
substance, has at one time or another been
employed: even the roots of trees, their bark,
the bine of hops, the tendrils of the vine, the
stalks of the nettle, the common thistle, the stem
of the hollyhock, the sugar cane, cabbage stalks,
wood shavings, saw dust, hay, straw, willow, and
the like.</p>

<p>At the present time straw is occasionally used,
sometimes in connection with other materials,
such as linen or cotton rags, and even with
considerable advantage, providing the processes
of preparation are thoroughly understood.
Where such is not the case, and the silica contained
in the straw has not been destroyed (by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
means of a strong alkali), the paper will invariably
be found more or less brittle; in some
cases so much so as to be hardly applicable to any
purpose whatever of practical utility. Specimens,
numbered 18 and 19, affixed at the end of this
work, are manufactured from as much as 80 per
cent. <em>straw</em> and 20 per cent. <em>rope</em>, and certainly,
as regards toughness, are excellent. No. 20,
is manufactured almost entirely from <em>wheat straw</em>,
which is first bleached to the utmost, and then
blued by an admixture of ultramarine. The waste,
however, which the straw undergoes, in addition
to a most expensive process of preparation,
necessarily precludes its adoption to any great
extent.</p>

<p>An ingenious invention has recently been patented
for converting large blocks of wood into
paper pulp; but to what extent it is likely to
receive favourable attention at the hands of paper
makers generally, is quite impossible to say.
The invention is very simple, consisting merely
of a wooden box enclosing a grindstone, which
has a roughened surface, and against which the
blocks of wood are kept in close contact by a
lever, a small stream of water being allowed to
flow upon the stone as it turns, in order to free
it of the pulp, and to assist in carrying it off
through an outlet at the bottom. Of course, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
is not expected, that the pulp thus produced
should be employed for any but the coarser kinds
of paper, in the manufacture of which there has
hitherto been found the greatest scarcity of material.
For all writing and printing purposes,
which manifestly are the most important, nothing
has yet been discovered, to lessen the value
of rags, neither is it at all probable that there will
be; indeed, the value of paper for some time past
has considerably declined, while during the most
exciting period of last year, the scarcity so much
talked of, was, in fact, comparatively trifling.</p>

<p>The annual consumption of rags in this country
alone far exceeds 120,000 tons, three-fourths
of which are imported, Italy and Germany
furnishing the principal supplies. That the
condition in which the rags are imported furnishes
any criterion of the national habits of the people
from which they came, as has been frequently
asserted, however plausible in theory, must, at
least, be received with caution. But that is
by no means important. The specimen of
printing paper, No. 21, was manufactured from
a selection far from cleanly; in fact, there was
not a white rag employed, while even fustians,
corduroy, and coloured rags formed a considerable
proportion.</p>

<p>In considering the various processes or stages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
of the manufacture of paper, we have first to
notice that, of carefully sorting and cutting the
rags into small pieces, which is done by women;
each woman standing at a table frame, the
upper surface of which consists of very coarse
wire-cloth; a large knife being fixed in the
centre of the table, nearly in a vertical position.
The woman stands so as to have the back of
the blade opposite to her, while at her right
hand on the floor is a large wooden box, with
several divisions. Her business consists in examining
the rags, opening the seams, removing
dirt, pins, needles, and buttons, of endless variety,
which would be liable to injure the machinery,
or damage the quality of the paper. She then
cuts the rags into small pieces, not exceeding
four inches square, by drawing them sharply
across the edge of the knife, at the same time
keeping each quality distinct, in the several divisions
of the box placed on her right hand.
During this process, much of the dirt, sand, and
so forth, passes through the wire-cloth into a
drawer underneath, which is occasionally cleaned
out. After this, the rags are removed to what
is called the <em>dusting machine</em>, which is a
large cylindrical frame, covered with similar
coarse iron wire-cloth, and having a powerful
revolving shaft extending through the interior,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
with a number of spokes fixed transversely,
nearly long enough to touch the cage. By
means of this contrivance, the machine being
fixed upon an incline of some inches to the foot,
the rags, which are put in at the top, have any
remaining particles of dust that may still adhere
to them effectually beaten out, by the time they
reach the bottom.</p>

<p>Some objection, however, may be made to this
method, which has a tendency to blow away at
the same time a considerable portion of fibre set
loose in cutting the rags, along with the dust.
To avoid this waste, an invention has recently
been brought out by a son of the late eminent
Mr. Fourdrinier, which he terms his “Patent
Accelerator.” The process adopted is simply
that of placing the rags in their dirty state in
water, and employing that as a medium for carrying
off the dust and dirt, in preference to air.
The invention has not yet been very extensively
used, and consequently I am not in a position to
say much as to its merits.</p>

<p>The rags being thus far cleansed, have
next to be boiled in <ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'an alkaline ley'">
an alkaline lye</ins> or solution,
made more or less strong, as the rags are
more or less coloured, the object being to get rid
of the remaining dirt and some of the colouring
matter. The proportion is from four to ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
pounds of carbonate of soda with one-third of
quick lime to the hundred weight of material.
In this the rags are boiled for several hours, according
to their quality.</p>

<p>The mode now adopted as the most recent improvement
is that of placing the rags in large
cylinders, which are constantly, though slowly,
revolving, thus causing the rags to be as frequently
turned over, and into which a jet of
steam is cast with a pressure of something near
30 lbs. to the square inch.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe50" id="i080">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i080.jpg" alt="Rag engine">
  <figcaption class="caption">RAG ENGINE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After this process of cleansing, the rags are
considered in a fit state to be torn or macerated
until they become reduced to pulp, which
was accomplished some five and thirty or forty
years since, by setting them to heat and ferment
for many days in close vessels, whereby in reality
they underwent a species of putrefaction. Another
method subsequently employed was that
of beating them by means of stamping rods, shod
with iron, working in strong oak or stone mortars,
and moved by water-wheel machinery. So
rude and ineffective however was this apparatus,
that no fewer than forty pairs of stamps were
required to operate a night and a day in preparing
one hundred weight of material. At the present
time, the average weekly consumption of
rags, at many paper mills, exceeds even 30 tons.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
The cylinder or engine mode of comminuting
rags into paper pulp appears to have been invented
in Holland, about the middle of the last
century, but received very little attention here
for some years afterwards. The accompanying
drawing will serve to convey some idea of the
wonderful rapidity with which the work is
at present accomplished. No less than <em>twelve
tons</em> per week can now be prepared by means of
this simple contrivance. The horizontal section
represents an oblong cistern, of cast iron,
or wood lined with lead, into which the rags,
with a sufficient quantity of water, are received.
It is divided by a partition, as shown (<span class="allsmcap">A</span>), to regulate
the course of the stuff. The spindle upon
which each cylinder (<span class="allsmcap">C</span>) moves, extending across
the engine, and being put in motion by a band
wheel or pinion at the point (<span class="allsmcap">B</span>). One cylinder,
is made to traverse at a much swifter rate
than the other, in order that the rags may be
the more effectually triturated. The cylinders
(<span class="allsmcap">C</span>), as shown in the vertical section, are furnished
with numerous cutters, running parallel
to the axis, and again beneath them similar cutters
are mounted (<span class="allsmcap">D</span>) somewhat obliquely, against
which, when in motion, the rags are drawn by
the rapid rotation of the cylinders, and thus reduced
to the smallest filaments requisite, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
not exceeding the sixteenth of an inch in
length; the distance between the fixed and
moveable blades being capable of any adjustment,
simply by elevating or depressing the bearings
upon which the necks of the shaft are supported.
When in operation, it is of course necessary to
enclose the cylinders in a case, as shown (<span class="allsmcap">E</span>),
otherwise a large proportion of the rags would
inevitably be thrown out of the engine. I should
mention, that the rags are first worked coarsely,
with a stream of water running through the engine,
which tends effectually to wash them, as
also to open their fibres; and in order to carry
off the dirty water, what is termed a <em>washing
drum</em> is usually employed, consisting simply of
a framework covered with very fine wire-gauze,
in the interior of which, connected with the shaft
or spindle, which is hollow, are two suction tubes,
and by this means, on the principle of a
syphon, the dirty water constantly flows away
through a larger tube running down outside,
which is connected with that in the centre, without
carrying away any of the fibre.</p>

<p>After this, the mass is placed in another
engine, where, if necessary, it is bleached by an
admixture of chloride of lime, which is retained
in the engine until its action becomes apparent.
The pulp is then let down into large slate cisterns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
to steep, prior to being reduced to a suitable
consistency by the beating engine, as already
described. The rolls or cylinders, however, of
the beating engine are always made to rotate
much faster than when employed in washing or
bleaching, revolving probably from 120 to 150
times per minute, and thus, supposing the cylinders
to contain 48 teeth each, passing over eight
others, as shown in the drawing, effecting no
fewer than 103,680 cuts in that short period.
From this the great advantage of the modern
engine over the old fashioned mortar machine, in
turning out a quantity of paper pulp, will be at
once apparent.</p>

<p>The operation of paper making, after the rags
or materials to be used have been thus reduced
and prepared, may be divided into two kinds;
that which is carried on in hand-mills, where the
formation of the sheet is performed by manual
labour; and that which is carried on in machine-mills,
where the paper is produced upon the machine
wire-cloth in one continuous web.</p>

<p>With respect to hand-made papers, the sheet
is formed by the vatman’s dipping a mould of fine
wire-cloth fixed upon a wooden frame, and having
what is termed a deckle, to determine the size of
the sheet, into a quantity of pulp which has been
previously mixed with water to a requisite consistency;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
when after gently shaking it to and fro
in a horizontal position, the fibres become so
connected as to form one uniform fabric, while
the water drains away. The deckle is then removed
from the mould, and the sheet of paper
turned off upon a felt, in a pile with many others,
a felt intervening between each sheet, and the
whole subjected to great pressure, in order to
displace the superfluous water; when after being
dried and pressed without the felts, the sheets
are dipped into a tub of fine animal size, the
superfluity of which is again forced out by another
pressing; each sheet after being finally
dried, undergoing careful examination before it
is finished.</p>

<p>Specimens 2, 3, 4, and 5, inserted at the end of
the work, serve to illustrate the different stages
of the manufacture. First, we have what is
termed the <em>water-leaf</em>, (2) or the condition
in which the paper appears after being pressed
between the felts—this is the first stage. Next,
a sheet from the bulk, as pressed without the
felts (3) which still remains in a state unfit for
writing on, not having been sized—and is in fact
but white blotting paper. Then we have a sheet
after sizing, which completely changes its character
(4); and lastly one with the beautiful
surface, which most of us, in this steel-pen age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
are capable of appreciating (5). This is produced
by placing the sheets separately between very
smooth copper plates, and then passing them
through rollers, which impart a pressure of from
20 to 30 tons. After only three or four such pressures,
it is simply called rolled (5), but if passed
through more frequently, the paper acquires a
higher surface, and is then called glazed (6).</p>

<p>The paper-making machine (<a href="#i002">see frontispiece</a>)
is constructed to imitate in a great measure, and
in some respects to improve, the processes used
in making paper by hand; but its chief advantages
are the increased rapidity with which it
accomplishes the manufacture, and the means
of producing paper of any size which can
practically be required.</p>

<p>By the agency of this admirable contrivance,
which is so adjusted as to produce the intended
effect with unerring precision, a process, which in
the old system of paper-making, occupied about
three <em>weeks</em>, is now performed in as many <em>minutes</em>.</p>

<p>The paper-making machine is supplied from
the “chest” or reservoir (<span class="allsmcap">F</span>), into which the
pulp descends from the beating engine, when
sufficiently ground; being kept in constant
motion, as it descends, by means of the agitator
(<span class="allsmcap">G</span>), in order that it shall not settle. From this
reservoir the pulp is again conveyed by a pipe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
into what is technically termed the “lifter”
(<span class="allsmcap">H</span>), which consists of a cast-iron wheel, enclosed
in a wooden case, and having a number
of buckets affixed to its circumference. The
trough (<span class="allsmcap">I</span>), placed immediately beneath the endless
wire (<span class="allsmcap">K</span>) is for the purpose of receiving the
water which drains away from the pulp during
the process of manufacture, and as this water is
frequently impregnated with certain chemicals
used in connexion with paper-making, it is returned
again by a conducting spout, into the
“lifter,” where, by the rotation of the buckets,
both the pulp and back-water become again thoroughly
mixed, and are together raised by the
lifter through the spout (<span class="allsmcap">L</span>) into the vat (<span class="allsmcap">M</span>)
where the pulp is strained by means of a sieve or
“knotter,” as it is called, which is usually formed
of brass, having fine slits cut in it to allow the
comminuted pulp to pass through, while it retains
all lumps and knots; and so fine are these openings,
in order to free the pulp entirely from anything
which would be liable to damage the
quality of the paper, that it becomes necessary to
apply a means of exhaustion underneath, in order
to facilitate the passage of the pulp through the
strainer.</p>

<p>I have frequently examined a mass of these
lumps collected upon the top of the knotter, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
particularly when printing papers are being manufactured,
and have generally found them composed,
to a very great extent, of India Rubber,
which is a source of much greater annoyance to
the paper maker than is readily conceived. For,
in the first place, it is next to impossible in
sorting and cutting the rags to free them entirely
from the braiding, and so forth, with which ladies
will insist upon adorning their dresses, and in the
next, the bleach failing to act upon a substance of
that character, the quality of the paper becomes
greatly deteriorated, by the large black specks
which it occasions, and which, by the combined
heat and pressure of the rolls and cylinders,
enlarge considerably as it proceeds.</p>

<p>Passing from this strainer the pulp is next made
to distribute itself equally throughout the entire
width of the machine, and is afterwards allowed
to flow over a small lip or ledge, in a regular and
even stream, whence it is received by the
upper surface of the endless wire (<span class="allsmcap">K</span>), upon which
the first process of manufacture takes place. Of
course the thickness of the paper depends in
some measure upon the speed at which the machine
is made to travel, but it is mainly determined
by the quantity of pulp allowed to flow
upon the wire, which by various contrivances
can be regulated to great nicety. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the specimens at the end, you will find one, No. 7,
which was made by this machine, and which is
considerably less than the thousandth of an inch
in thickness,—a thousand sheets measuring but
three quarters of an inch. And I would call your
attention to the fact, that although so thin, it is
capable of being coloured, it is capable of being
glazed, it is capable of receiving a water-mark;
and what is perhaps still more astonishing, a strip
not exceeding four inches in width, will be found
capable of sustaining a weight of twenty pounds:
so great is its tenacity.</p>

<p>But, to return to the machine itself. The
quantity of pulp required to flow from the vat (<span class="allsmcap">M</span>)
being determined; it is first received by the continuous
woven wire (<span class="allsmcap">K</span>), upon which it forms itself
into paper. This wire-gauze, which resembles a
jack-towel, passing over the small copper rollers
(<span class="allsmcap">N</span>), round the larger one marked (<span class="allsmcap">O</span>), and being
kept in proper tension by two others placed underneath.
A gentle vibratory motion from side
to side is given to the wire, which assists to
spread the pulp evenly, and also to facilitate the
separation of the water, and by this means, aided
by a suction pump, the pulp solidifies as it advances.
The two black squares on either side of
the “dandy” roller (<span class="allsmcap">P</span>) indicate the position of
two wooden boxes, from which the air is partially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
exhausted, thus causing the atmospheric pressure
to operate in compacting the pulp into paper, the
water and moisture being drawn through the wire,
and the pulp retained on the surface.</p>

<p>Next, we have to notice the deckle or boundary
straps (<span class="allsmcap">Q</span>) which regulate the width of the paper,
travelling at the same rate as the wire, and
thus limiting the spread of pulp. The “dandy”
roller (<span class="allsmcap">P</span>), is employed to give any impression
to the paper that may be required. We
may suppose for instance, that the circumference
of that roller answers exactly to the length or
breadth of the wire forming a hand mould, which,
supposing such wire to be fixed or curved in that
form, would necessarily leave the same impression
as when employed in the ordinary way. Being
placed between the air boxes, the paper becomes
impressed by it when in a half formed state, and
whatever marks are thus made, the paper will
effectually retain. The marks seen in Specimens
2, 3, 4, and 5, have been occasioned by a hand
mould, those in 6, 7, 9, and 11, are impressions given
by a dandy roller. The two rollers following the
dandy, marked (<span class="allsmcap">R</span>) and (<span class="allsmcap">O</span>), are termed couching
rollers, from their performing a similar operation
in the manufacture of machine-made papers, to
the business of the coucher in conducting the
process by hand. They are simply wooden rollers
covered with felt. In some instances, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the upper couch roll (<span class="allsmcap">R</span>) is made to answer
a double purpose. In making writing or other
papers, where smalts, ultramarine, and various
colours are used, considerable difference will
frequently be found in the tint of the paper when
the two sides are compared, in consequence of
the colouring matter sinking to the lower side,
by the natural subsidence of the water, or from
the action of the suction boxes; and to obviate
this, instead of employing the ordinary couch
roll, which acts upon the <em>upper</em> surface of the
paper, a hollow one is substituted, having a
suction box within it, acted upon by an air pump,
which tends in some measure to counteract the
effect, justly considered objectionable. Merging
from those rollers the paper is received from the
wire-gauze by a continuous felt (<span class="allsmcap">S</span>), which conducts
it through two pair of pressing rollers, and afterwards
to the drying cylinders. You will observe,
that the paper, after passing through the first
pair of rollers, is carried along the felt for some
distance, and then turned over, in order to
receive a corresponding pressure on the other
side, thus obviating the inequality of surface
which would otherwise be apparent, especially if
the paper were to be employed for books.</p>

<p>The advantage gained by the use of so great a
length of felt, is simply, that it becomes less necessary
to stop the machine for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
washing it, than would be the case if the felt
were limited in length to its absolute necessity.</p>

<p>In some instances, when the paper being made
is sized in the pulp with such an ingredient as
<em>resin</em>, the felt becomes so completely clogged in
the space of a few hours, that unless a very great
and apparently unnecessary length of felt be employed,
a considerable waste of time is constantly
incurred in washing or changing the felt. To
obviate all this—whether waste of time or waste
of felt—I have suggested in one or two quarters,
the propriety of passing the felt, as it returns
from conducting the paper to the heated cylinders,
through a trough of water, and while travelling
through the water to apply suction boxes to both
the upper and lower surface of the felt, which by
an alternate action, might be made sufficiently
powerful to remove all impurity, without in any
way obstructing the progress of the felt; which
if found necessary, might be assisted, while at the
same time the felt would be restored to its original
condition, by employing a suction <em>roller</em>
to which a steady motion was given in connexion
with the machine.</p>

<p>The operation of the manufacture will now
be apparent. The pulp flowing from the reservoir
into the lifter, and thence through
the strainer, passes over a small lip to the
continuous wire, being there partially compacted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
by the shaking motion, more thoroughly
so on its passage over the air boxes, receiving
any desired marks by means of the dandy roller
passing over the continuous felt between the first
pressing rollers, then turned over to receive a
corresponding pressure on the other side, and
from thence off to the drying cylinders, which
are heated more or less by injected steam; the
cylinder which receives the paper first, being
heated less than the second, the second than the
third, and so on; the paper after passing over
those cylinders, being finally wound upon a reel,
as shown, unless it be printing paper, which can
be sized sufficiently in the pulp, by an admixture
of alum, soda, and resin, or the like; in which
case it may be at once conducted to the cutting
machine, to be divided into any length and width
required. But, supposing it to be intended for
writing purposes, it has first to undergo a more
effectual method of sizing, as shown in the accompanying
drawing. The size in this instance
being made from parings obtained from tanners,
curriers, and parchment-makers, as employed in
the case of hand-made papers. Of course, sizing
in the pulp or in the engine offers many advantages,
but as gelatine, or animal size, which is
really essential for all good writing qualities,
cannot at present be employed during the process
of manufacturing by the machine without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
injury to the felts, it becomes necessary to pass
the web of paper, after it has been dried by the
cylinders, through this apparatus.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe60" id="i094">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i094.jpg" alt="Sizing apparatus">
  <figcaption class="caption">SIZING APPARATUS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In most cases, however, the paper is at once
guided as it issues from the machine, through
the tub of size, and is thence carried over the
skeleton drums shown, inside each of which
are a number of fans rapidly revolving; sometimes
there are forty or fifty of these
drums in succession, the whole confined in
a chamber heated by steam. I have seen
a paper machine with the sizing apparatus
attached, which from the wire-cloth where the
pulp first flows on, to the cutting machine
at the extremity, measured no less than one
thousand feet. The advantage of drying the
paper in this manner over so many of these
drums is, that it turns out much harder and
stronger, than if dried more rapidly over heated
cylinders. Some manufacturers adopt a peculiar
process of sizing, which in fact answers very
much better, and is alike applicable to papers
made by hand or by machine, provided the latter
description be first cut into pieces or sheets of the
required dimensions. The contrivance consists of
two revolving felts, between which the sheets are
carried under several rollers through a long trough
of size, being afterwards hung up to dry upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
lines, previously to rolling or glazing. The paper
thus sized becomes much harder and stronger,
by reason of the freedom with which the sheets
can contract in drying; and this is mainly the
reason why paper made by hand continues to be
so much tougher than that made by the machine,
in consequence of the natural tendency of the pulp
to contract in drying, and consequently becoming,
where no resistance is offered, more entwined or
entangled, which of course adds very considerably
to the strength and durability of the paper.
In making by the machine, this tendency, you
will observe, is completely checked.</p>

<p>The next operation which we have to notice,
now that the paper is finished, is that of cutting
it into standard sizes. Originally, the reel upon
which it was finally wound, was formed so that
its diameter might be lessened or increased at
pleasure, according to the sizes which were required.
Thus, for instance, supposing we wanted
to cut the web of paper into sheets of 18 inches
in length, we should either lessen the diameter
of the reel to 6 inches, and thus the circumference
to 18 inches, or if convenient increase it to
36 inches, afterwards cutting the paper in two
with a large knife, similar in size and shape
to that employed by a cheesemonger; the width
of the web being regulated by the deckle straps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
(<span class="allsmcap">Q</span>) to either twice or three times the width of the
sheet, as the case might be. However, in regard
to the length considerable waste, of necessity,
arose, from the great increase in the circumference
of the reel as the paper was wound
upon it, and to remedy this, several contrivances
have been invented. To dwell upon their various
peculiarities or separate stages of improvement,
would, no doubt, prove to the general reader of
little comparative interest, I shall, therefore,
confine my attention to a brief explanation of the
cutting machine, of which I have given an illustration,
and which is unquestionably the best, as
well as the most ingenious, invention of the kind.</p>

<p>The first movement or operation peculiar to
this machine is that of cutting the web of paper
longitudinally, into such widths as may be required.
And this is effected by means of circular
blades, placed at stated distances, which receive
the paper as it issues direct from the other machinery,
and by a very swift motion, much greater
than that at which the paper travels, slit it up with
unerring precision wherever they may be fixed.</p>

<p>A pair of those circular blades is shown in the
drawing (<em>a</em>), the upper one being much larger
than the lower, which is essential to the smoothness
of the cut. And not only is the upper
blade larger in circumference, but it is also made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
to revolve with much greater rapidity, by means
of employing a small pinion, worked by one at
least twice its diameter, which is fixed upon the
same shaft as the lower blade, to which the motive
power is applied. The action aimed at is precisely
such as we obtain from a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>The web, as it is termed by the paper-maker,
being thus severed longitudinally, the next operation
is that of cutting it off into sheets of
some particular length horizontally; and to do
this requires a most ingenious movement. To
give a very general idea of the contrivance,
the dotted line is intended to represent the paper
travelling on with a rapidity in some cases of 80
feet per minute, and yet its course has to be
temporarily arrested while the required separation
is effected, and that too without the paper’s
accumulating in any mass, or getting creased in
the slightest degree.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe50" id="i100">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i100.jpg" alt="Cutting machine">
  <figcaption class="caption">CUTTING MACHINE.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The large drum (<em>b</em>), over which the paper
passes, in the direction indicated by the arrows,
has simply an alternating motion, which serves
to gather the paper in such lengths as may be
required. The crank arm (<em>c</em>), which is capable
of any adjustment either at top or bottom,
regulating the extent of the movement backwards
and forwards, and thus the length of the
sheet. As soon as the paper to be cut off has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
passed below the point (<em>d</em>), at which a <em>presser</em> is
suspended, having an alternating motion given
to it, in order to make it approach to, and recede
from, a stationary presser-board; it is taken hold
of as it descends from the drum, and the length
pendant from the presser, is instantly cut off by
the moveable knife (<em>e</em>), to which motion is given
by the crank (<em>f</em>), the connecting rod (<em>g</em>), the
lever (<em>h</em>), and the connecting rod (<em>i</em>). The combined
motion of these rods and levers, admits of
the moveable knife (<em>e</em>), remaining nearly quiescent
for a given time, and then speedily closing
upon the fixed knife (<em>k</em>), cutting off the paper in a
similar manner to a pair of shears, when it immediately
slides down a board, or in some instances
is carried along a revolving felt, at the
extremity of which several men or boys are
placed to receive the sheets, according to the
number into which the width of the web is
divided.</p>

<p>As soon as the pressers are closed for a length
of paper to be cut off, the motion of the gathering
drum is reversed, smoothing out the paper
upon its surface, which is now held between
the pressers; the tension roll (<em>l</em>), taking up the
slack in the paper as it accumulates, <ins class="corr" id="tn-77" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'or ratherb earing'">
or rather bearing</ins> it gently down, <ins class="corr" id="tn-77a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'until th emovement'">
until the movement</ins>
of the drum is again reversed to furnish another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
length. The handle (<em>m</em>), is employed merely to
stop a portion of the machinery, should the
water-mark not fall exactly in the centre of the
sheet, when by this means it can be momentarily
adjusted.</p>

<p>The paper being thus made, and cut up into
sheets of stated dimensions, is next looked over
and counted out into quires of 24 sheets, and
afterwards into reams of 20 quires; which subsequently,
under the superintendence of an Excise
Officer, are carefully weighed and stamped, previously
to their being sent into the market.</p>

<p>Connected with the manufacture of paper,
there is one point of considerable interest and
importance, and that is, what is commonly, but
erroneously, termed the <em>water-mark</em>, which may
be noticed in the Times Newspaper, in the New
Bank of England Notes, Cheques and Bills, as
also in every Postage and Receipt Label of the
present day.</p>

<p>The curious, and in some instances absurd
terms, which now puzzle us so much in describing
the different sorts and sizes of paper, may
frequently be explained by reference to the
various paper-marks which have been adopted
at different periods. In ancient times, when
comparatively few people could read, pictures of
every kind were much in use where writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
would now be employed. Every shop, for
instance, had its sign, as well as every public-house,
and those signs were not then, as they
often are now, only painted upon a board,
but were invariably actual models of the thing
which the sign expressed—as we still occasionally
see some such sign as a bee-hive, a tea-canister,
or a doll, and the like. For the same reason
printers employed some device, which they put
upon the title pages and at the end of their
books, and paper makers also introduced marks,
by way of distinguishing the paper of their manufacture
from that of others; which marks
becoming common, naturally gave their names
to different sorts of paper. And since names
often remain long after the origin of them is
forgotten and circumstances are changed, it is
not surprising to find the old names still in use,
though in some cases they are not applied to
the same things which they originally denoted.
One of the illustrations of ancient water-mark
which I have given in the accompanying plate;
that of an open hand with a star at the top,
which was in use as early as 1530; probably
gave the name to what is still called <em>hand</em>
paper.</p>

<p>Another very favourite paper-mark, at a subsequent
period 1540-60, was the jug or pot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
which is also shown, and would appear to have
originated the term <em>pot</em> paper. The foolscap
was a later device, and does not appear to have
been nearly of such long continuance as the
former. It has given place to the figure of
Britannia, or that of a lion rampant, supporting
the cap of liberty on a pole. The name, however,
has continued, and we still denominate paper of
a particular size, by the title of <em>foolscap</em>. The
original figure has the cap and bells, of which
we so often read in old plays and histories,
as the particular head-dress of the fool, who at
one time formed part of every great man’s
establishment.</p>

<p>I have met with the water-mark of a cap,
much simpler than that which we have just
noticed, somewhat resembling the jockey-caps of
the present day, with a trifling ornamentation or
addition to the upper part. The first edition of
“Shakspeare,” printed by <em>Isaac Jaggard &amp; Ed.
Blount</em>, 1623, will be found to contain this mark,
interspersed with several others of a different
character. No doubt the general use of the term
<em>cap</em> to various papers of the present day owes its
origin to marks of this description.</p>

<p>The term <em>imperial</em> was in all probability derived
from the finest specimens of papyri, which
were so called by the ancients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Post paper seems to have derived its name
from the post-horn, which at one time was its
distinguishing mark. It does not appear to have
been used prior to the establishment of the
general post-office (1670), when it became the
custom to blow a horn, to which circumstance no
doubt we may attribute its introduction. The
mark is still frequently used, but the same change
which has so much diminished the number of
painted signs in the streets of our towns and
cities, has nearly made paper-marks a matter of
antiquarian curiosity; the maker’s name being
now generally used, and the mark, in the few instances
where it still remains, serving the purpose
of mere ornament, rather than that of distinction.</p>

<p>Water-marks, however, have at various periods
been the means of detecting frauds, forgeries and
impositions, in our courts of law and elsewhere,
to say nothing of the protection they afford
in the instances already referred to, such as
bank notes, cheques, receipt, bill, and postage
stamps. The celebrated Curran once distinguished
himself in a case which he had undertaken,
by shrewdly referring to the water-mark,
which effectually determined the verdict. And
another instance, which I introduce merely in
the form of an amusing anecdote, occurred once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
at Messina, where the monks of a certain monastery
exhibited, with great triumph, a letter as
being written by the Virgin Mary with her own
hand. Unluckily for them, however, this was
not, as it easily might have been, written upon
the ancient papyrus, but on paper made of rags.
On one occasion a visitor, to whom this was
shown, observed, with affected solemnity, that
the letter involved also a <em>miracle</em>, for the paper
on which it was written was not in existence
until several centuries after the mother of our
Lord had died.</p>

<p>A further illustration of the kind occurs in a
work entitled “Ireland’s Confessions,” which was
published respecting his fabrication of the Shakspeare
manuscripts,—a literary forgery even still
more remarkable, I think, than that which is
said to have been perpetrated by Chatterton, as
Rowley’s Poems.</p>

<p>The interest which at the time was universally
felt in this production of Ireland’s, may be partially
gathered from the fact, that the whole of
the original edition, which appeared in the form
of a shilling pamphlet, was disposed of in a few
hours; while so great was the eagerness to obtain
copies afterwards, that single impressions
were sold in an auction room at the extravagant
price of a guinea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>This gentleman tells us, at one part of his explanation,
that the sheet of paper which he used
was the outside of several others, on some of
which accounts had been kept in the reign of
Charles the First; and being at that time wholly
unacquainted with the water-marks used in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, “I carefully selected
(says he) two half-sheets, not having any mark
whatever, on which I penned my first effusion.”
A few pages further on he writes—“Being thus
urged forward to the production of more manuscripts,
it became necessary that I should possess
a sufficient quantity of old paper to enable me to
proceed, in consequence of which I applied to a
bookseller, named Verey, in Great May’s Buildings,
St. Martin’s Lane, who, for the sum of five
shillings, suffered me to take from all the folio
and quarto volumes in his shop, the fly leaves
which they contained. By this means I was
amply stored with that commodity; nor did I
fear any mention of the circumstance by Mr.
Verey, whose quiet unsuspecting disposition, I
was well convinced, would never lead him to
make the transaction public, in addition to which
he was not likely even to know anything concerning
the supposed Shaksperian discovery by
myself, and even if he had, I do not imagine that
my purchase of the old paper in question, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
have excited in him the smallest degree of suspicion.
As I was fully aware from the variety
of water-marks which are in existence at the
present day, that they must have constantly
been altered since the period of Elizabeth, and
being for some time wholly unacquainted with
the water-marks of that age, I very carefully
produced my first specimens of the writing on
such sheets of old paper as had no mark whatever.
Having heard it frequently stated that
the appearance of such marks on the papers
would have greatly tended to establish their validity,
I listened attentively to every remark
which was made upon the subject, and from
thence I at length gleaned the intelligence that
a jug was the prevalent water-mark of the reign
of Elizabeth, in consequence of which I inspected
all the sheets of old paper then in my possession,
and having selected such as had the jug upon
them, I produced the succeeding manuscripts
upon these, being careful, however, to mingle
with them a certain number of blank leaves, that
the production on a sudden of so many water-marks
might not excite suspicion in the breasts
of those persons who were most conversant with
the manuscripts.”</p>

<p>Thus, this notorious literary forgery, through
the cunning ingenuity of the perpetrator, ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
proved so successful as to deceive many
learned and able critics of the age. Indeed, on
one occasion a kind of certificate was drawn up,
stating that the undersigned names were affixed
by gentlemen who entertained no doubt whatever
as to the validity of the Shaksperian production,
and that they voluntarily gave such
public testimony of their convictions upon the
subject. To this document several names were
appended by persons as conspicuous for their
erudition as they were pertinacious in their
opinions.</p>

<p>The water-mark in the form of a letter <em>p</em>, of
which I have given an illustration, is taken from
Caxton’s well-known work, “The Game of the
Chesse,” a <em>fac simile</em> of which is about to be published
as a tribute to his memory. Paper has
recently been made expressly for the purpose,
in exact representation of the original, and containing
this water-mark, which will be found
common in works printed by him.</p>

<p>The ordinary mode of effecting such paper
marks as we have been describing is that of
affixing a stout wire in the form of any object
to be represented to the surface of the fine wire-gauze,
of which the hand-mould, or machine
dandy roller is constructed.</p>

<p>The perfection, however, to which water-marks
have now attained, which in many instances is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
really very beautiful, is owing to a more ingenious
method recently patented, and since adopted by
the Bank of England, as affording considerable
protection to the public <ins class="corr" id="tn-86" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'indeterm ining the'">
in determining the</ins> genuineness of a bank note.</p>

<p>For the original idea of producing light and
shade, as seen in specimens 1, 13, and 15, we are
indebted to Mr. Wm. Henry Smith, whose patient
perseverance, and laborious efforts, at length
enabled him to overcome many difficulties,
and finally to produce not only any peculiarity
of design, however complicate, but also to
secure its repetition with a certainty of uniformity
which, in the process of manufacture
as hitherto conducted, it was found impossible to
accomplish.</p>

<p>To produce a line water-mark of the character
shown in specimens 10, 12, and 16, or of any of the
autographs or crests in No. 14, (which sheet was
produced from the mould which I employed at
the London Institution,) we might either engrave
the pattern or device first in some yielding surface,
precisely as we should engrave a copper-plate
for printing, and afterwards by immersing the
plate in a solution of sulphate of copper, and
electrotyping it in the usual way, allow the
interstices of the engraving to give it as were a
casting of pure copper, and thus an exact representation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of the original device, which, upon being
removed from the plate, and affixed to the surface
of the wire-gauze forming the mould, would produce
a corresponding impression in the paper:
or, supposing perfect identity to be essential, as
in the case of a bank note, we might engrave
the design upon the surface of a steel die, taking
care to cut those parts in the die deepest which
are intended to give greater effect in the paper,
and then, after having hardened, and otherwise
properly prepared the die, it would be placed
under a steam hammer or other stamping apparatus,
for the purpose of producing what is
technically termed a “force,” which is required to
assist in transferring an impression from the die
to a plate of sheet brass. This being done, the
die, with the mould-plate in it, would next be
taken to a perforating or cutting machine, where
the back of the mould-plate—that is the portion
which projects above the face of the die—would
be removed, while that portion which was impressed
into the design engraven, would remain
untouched, and this being subsequently taken from
the interstices of the die and placed in a frame
upon a backing of fine wire-cloth, becomes a
mould for the manufacture of paper of the
pattern which is desired, or for the production<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of any water-mark, autograph, crest or device,
however complicate.</p>

<p>Light and shade, as seen in Nos. 1, 13, and 15, are
occasioned by a very similar process, but one which
perhaps requires a little more care, and necessarily
becomes somewhat more tedious. For instance,
in the former case the pulp is distributed
equally throughout the entire surface of the wire
forming the mould, whereas <em>now</em> we have to contrive
the means of increasing to a very great nicety
the thickness or distribution of the pulp, and at
the same time to make provision for the water’s
draining away. This has been accomplished, as
in the case of No. 13, by first taking an electrotype
of the raised surface of any model or design,
and again from that, forming in a similar manner
a matrix or mould, both of which are subsequently
mounted upon lead or gutta percha,
in order that they may withstand the pressure
which is required to be put upon them in giving
impression to a sheet of very fine copper wire-gauze,
which, in the form of a mould, and in the
hands of the vatman, suffices ultimately to produce
such beautiful transparent effects in paper pulp
as those to which I have called your attention.
By similar means a portrait of the Emperor
Napoleon was produced for the Paris Exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>The other specimens, 1 and 15, are produced in
the same manner as the word “Five” in the centre
of the new Bank of England note. The deepest
shadows in the water-mark being occasioned by
the deepest engraving upon the die, the lightest,
by the shallowest, and so forth; the die being
employed to give impression by means of the
stamping press and “force” to the fine wire-gauze
itself, which by this means, providing the die be properly
cut, is accomplished far more successfully
than by any other process, and with the additional
advantage of securing perfect identity.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to call attention to the
contrast as regards the method of mould-making
originally practised, and that which has recently
been adopted by the Bank of England. In a pair
of five pound note moulds, prepared by the old process,
there were 8 curved borders, 16 figures, 168
large waves, and 240 letters, which had all to be
separately secured by the finest wire to the
waved surface. There were 1,056 wires, 67,584
twists, and the same repetition where the stout
wires were introduced to support the under surface.
Therefore, with the backing, laying, large
waves, figures, letters, and borders, before a pair of
moulds was completed, there were some hundreds
of thousands of stitches, most of which are now
avoided by the new patent. But further, by this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
multitudinous stitching and sewing, the parts
were never placed precisely in the same position,
and the water-mark was consequently never
identical. Now, the same die gives impression to
the metal which transfers it to the water-mark,
with a certainty of identity unattainable before,
and one could almost say, never to be surpassed.</p>

<p>But, as it has been properly remarked,
may we not detect principles in this process
which are not only valuable to the Bank, but to
all public establishments having important documents
on paper, for what can exceed the value of
such a test for discovering the deceptions of dishonest
men. One’s signature, crest, or device of
any kind, rendering the paper exclusively one’s
own, can now be secured in a pair of moulds, at
the cost merely of a few guineas.</p>

<p>Thus then, I have endeavoured briefly to glance
at all the varied manipulations comprised in the
term Paper Making; from the soiled rags,
which by this regenerating process, are converted
into pure and spotless paper, and thence to
the operations which in degree distinguish it,
until finally, the stronger the test for illuminating
its perfection, but suffices to prove it of
that most aristocratic class, to which belongs our
new bank note.</p>

<p>Not long since I heard of a very inquisitive
gentleman, as some people would term him,
who wrote to a friend of mine asking him to obtain
certain information respecting the manufacture
of <em>isinglass</em>; and although the questions put,
were by no means essential to general knowledge,
my friend complied with his request, and
forwarded the application to the party immediately
interested in its production; who, with
similar promptitude undertook to furnish the
answers per return of post, upon receiving
from the anxious applicant a repetition of the
inquiry, accompanied by his cheque for three
thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Now, it is not at all improbable that many
into whose hands this book may fall will be
disposed to charge me with similar motives,
as concealing secrets connected with paper
making. It is, however, a reliable fact, that
nothing can be more simple or straightforward
than the manufacture of that, which, for want of
a more comprehensive expression, I must denominate
<em>genuine paper</em>. Chemical aid, combined with
great practical skill, is absolutely indispensable,
I admit, to enable one to keep pace with competition
in the present day; when even the rags
and tatters, cast off by the very poorest of
the poor, may now be forwarded after sunrise,
many miles distant, and before sunset, received
back again converted into a becoming ground-work
for the most enchanting <i lang="fr">billet-doux</i>. Still,
productions of this character, when contrasted
with the results of a slow and simple manipulation
of finer materials, even to the unpractised
eye, will be found far inferior, as regards the one
grand test of superiority, viz., <em>durability</em>. The
slower the process of manufacture is conducted
from beginning to end, from the trituration of
the “stuff” in the rag engine, to the formation
of the sheet, its sizing, drying, and rolling, the
stronger and more durable will the paper ultimately
turn out. No. 17, which is a specimen of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
paper thus carefully made, and almost as tough
and durable as parchment, is capable of sustaining
a weight of no less than 200 lbs., simply by
means of a slip the width of a bank note. If,
however, we glance at the other extreme, and
take the aids frequently adopted to produce paper
of apparent excellence from comparatively worthless
materials, we shall find occasion to regret
more than one form of artificial assistance, which
is perpetually liable to objection. The effects,
for instance, of excessive bleaching are still occasionally
manifested, although by a better system
of washing the pulp and the use of
counteracting chemicals, evils which at one time
resulted therefrom are now mainly checked.
Within the recollection of my father, it was not
at all an uncommon occurrence for a parcel of
paper to become so completely perished from the
circumstance of its not having been thoroughly
washed after bleaching, that to draw a sheet as a
sample, and to fold it up in the usual way, was
found utterly impossible, without the sheets being
cracked or broken at every fold. In some instances,
the fibre was so completely destroyed,
that an entire ream, composed of 480 sheets,
might be as readily snapped asunder as a piece
of rotten wood, merely by giving it a sharp blow
against the back of a chair. The evils and inconveniences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
which must have resulted from
this are altogether incalculable. Mr. Hansard
(“Typographia,” 1825,) thus writes, “Whole
piles of quired stock, meaning books unbound,
are already crumbling to dust in the warehouses
of booksellers, never to come to light as books,
and many a volume designed to enrich the library
of its possessor and to descend as an heir-loom
to posterity, now presents to the mortified owner
its elegant print surrounded by a margin of tan
colour, which in some instances forms, as it were,
a complete frame round each page, the oil varnish
in the composition of the ink seeming to
preserve the interstices between the print from
the same kind of discoloration. School books (he
adds) printed on this species of paper, will
scarcely last out their destined period, from one
vacation to the next.” Another gentleman informs
us, speaking of a quantity of Bibles, which
were printed for the British and Foreign Bible
Society, that one in his possession, printed at the
University press at Oxford in 1816, (which had
never been used) was then, within a year or two
afterwards, literally crumbling into dust. “Almost
the entire book of Genesis (says he) has
mouldered away, and left not a trace behind.”
Of course, paper of this description (if it deserves
the name at all) would prove very bad stock in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
like manner for the stationer, being for any purpose
whatever as utterly useless as it was worthless,
with but one exception, which in the case of a
large parcel of this description, I understand, was
once adopted, viz., that of shipping it in very
common cases, thus securing the drawback, which,
at that time, was far more worth consideration
than it would be now, and eventually consigning
it to the fate of innumerable other treasures
within the boundless limits of the ocean.</p>

<p>If to speak of the various artificial aids which
the manufacturer has recourse to in the present
day be necessary, it surely cannot but be equally
advisable, to point out their main cause; and if
blame exist at all, or fault be found, it cannot, I
apprehend, be rested with greater safety than
with those who, stipulating their own terms,
must of necessity be supplied in their own way.
The paper maker requires to be remunerated;
and with competition to grapple with and contend
against, not only all the improvements
which mechanical science is capable of supplying,
must be adopted by him, but even in many
cases, however much to be regretted, he is
tempted to an intermixture of noxious and
heterogeneous materials, in order that the minimum
price may be attained.</p>

<p>Some specimens of paper will be found to contain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
as much as one-fourth their weight of gypsum;
and in fact, even worse material, as a
means of adulteration, is as eagerly sought after
by the manufacturer of paper, as the public generally,
to the sacrifice of quality, seek the cheapest
article which it is possible to procure. I
need but refer, as an instance, to the packing
papers of the present day, of which one sheet
properly made (25), contrasted with one of the
same weight of the sort usually selected, will be
found to possess three times the amount of
strength, although not 10 per cent. higher in price.</p>

<p>With a finer class of papers common materials
are as readily employed, through the assistance
of some colouring matter, which tends to conceal
the imperfection. Indeed, it would be difficult
to name an instance of apparent deception more
forcible than that which is accomplished by the
use of ultramarine. Until very recently the fine
bluish tinge given to many writing papers was
derived from the admixture of that expensive
mineral blue, the oxide of cobalt, generally
termed <em>smalts</em>, and which has still the advantage
over the ultramarine of imparting a
colour which will endure for a much longer
period. One pound of ultramarine, however,
going further than four of smalts at the same
price, the former necessarily meets with more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
extended application, and where the using is
rightly understood, and the materials employed
instead of being fine rags, comparative rubbish,
excessively bleached; its application proves remarkably
serviceable in concealing for a time
all other irregularities, and even far surpassing
in appearance the best papers of the kind.</p>

<p>At first the introduction of ultramarine led
to some difficulty in sizing the paper, for so long
as smalts continued to be used, any amount of
alum might be employed, and it was actually
added to the size to preserve it from putrefaction.
But since artificial ultramarine is bleached
by alum, it became of course necessary to add
this salt to the size in very small proportions,
and as a natural consequence, the gelatine was no
longer protected from the action of the air,
which led to incipient decomposition, and in such
cases the putrefaction once commenced, proceeded
even after the size was dried on the paper,
and gave to it a most offensive smell, which
rendered the paper unsaleable. This difficulty,
however, has now been overcome, and providing
the size be quite free from taint when
applied to the paper, and quickly dried, putrefaction
will not subsequently occur; but if decay
has once commenced, it cannot be arrested by
drying only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>The practice of blueing the paper pulp had its
origin in a singularly accidental circumstance,
which not merely as an historical fact, but as
forming an amusing anecdote, is perhaps worth
mentioning. It occurred about the year 1790,
at a paper mill belonging to Mr. Buttenshaw,
whose wife, on the occasion in question, was
superintending the washing of some fine linen,
when accidentally she dropped her bag of powdered
blue into the midst of some pulp in a
forward state of preparation, and so great was
the fear she entertained of the mischief she
had done, seeing the blue rapidly amalgamated
with the pulp, that all allusion to it was
studiously avoided; until, on Mr. Buttenshaw’s
inquiring in great astonishment what it was that
had imparted the peculiar colour to the pulp, his
wife, perceiving that no very great damage had
been done, took courage and at once disclosed
the secret, for which she was afterwards rewarded
in a remarkable manner by her husband, who
being naturally pleased with an advance of so
much as four shillings per bundle, upon submitting
the <em>improved</em> make to the London market,
immediately purchased a costly scarlet cloak,
(somewhat more congenial to taste in those days,
it is presumed, than it would be now,) which he
carefully conveyed home, and presented with
much satisfaction to the sharer of his joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Although the practice of blueing paper is not,
perhaps, so customary now as was the case a few
years back, the extent to which it is still carried
may be a matter of considerable astonishment.
On its first introduction, when, as regards colour,
the best paper was anything but pleasing, so
striking a novelty would no doubt be hailed as
a great improvement, and as such received into
general use, but when we contrast a <em>first class</em>
paper now (8), without any colouring matter
whatever, and without any superfluous marks
upon its surface, with the miserable blue tints
one so frequently sees, it becomes a source of
surprise, that the superior delicacy of the former
is not more generally appreciated.</p>

<p>The only objection which can be urged against
the use of a colourless paper is, its comparative
transparency when glazed in the ordinary way:
but this is by no means essential. A finished
surface imparted by calendering, when contrasted
with one more highly glazed, will be found
wholly superior for a writing paper, and unobjectionable
as regards opaqueness.</p>

<p>In paper making, there has seldom, perhaps,
arisen a greater difficulty than in furnishing a
supply suited to the purposes of photography.
Unquestionably, great care is requisite in the
selection of the materials, their preparation, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
subsequent manufacture. But the difficulty is
owing more to the want of positive information
on the part of the photographer, than to failure
in the exertions of the Paper Maker. I have
recently been informed by a gentleman who
has devoted much time and attention to this
particular class of paper, that after forwarding
specimens to many score members of that profession,
and inviting observations and suggestions
thereon, not one in ten favoured him with
any reply, and of those who did, although many
first-rate names might be mentioned, the conclusions
to which they severally came were totally
adverse.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to wander further into
the field of paper and paper making than to mark
the boundary which has been set up by Act of
Parliament, in the form of Excise Regulations,
with a few general observations upon the varieties
and peculiarities of manufactured paper, as a
becoming and at the present time somewhat
important termination to our subject.</p>

<p>Manufactured paper, independently of the miscellaneous
kinds, such as blotting, filtering, and
the like, which are rendered absorbent by the free
use of <em>woollen</em> rags, may be divided into three
distinct classes, <em>viz.</em>, writing, printing, and wrapping.
The former again into <em>five</em>, cream wove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
(8), yellow wove (17), blue wove (7), cream laid
(16), and blue laid (5). The printing into <em>two</em>,
laid and wove, and the latter into <em>four</em>, blue (22),
purple (24), brown (25), and whited brown (23), as
it is commonly termed. Each of these sorts
ought again to be classified, until it would appear
as if not merely all the wants, wishes, and fancies
of mankind had been fully studied and provided
for, but that even the utmost bounds of variety
in like manner had been included, in order to
test the comprehensiveness of human caprice.</p>

<p>To give a simple definition of the mode
adopted for distinguishing the various kinds, I
must include, with the class denominated <em>writing</em>
papers, those which are used for drawing, which
being sized in like manner, and with the exception
of one or two larger kinds, of precisely
the same dimensions as those passing by the
same name, which are used strictly for writing
purposes, (the only distinction, in fact, being,
that the drawings are cream wove, while the
writings are laid,) there would of course be no
necessity for separating them. Indeed, since
many of the sizes used for printing are exactly
the same as those which would be named as
writing papers, for the sake of abridgment I
will reduce my distinctions of difference to but
two heads, fine and coarse; under the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
including the ordinary brown papers, the whited
brown, or small hand quality, and the blues and
purples, used by grocers. The smallest size of
the fine quality, as sent from the mill, measures
12½ by 15 inches, and is termed Pot; next to
that Foolscap, 17 by 13½; then Post, 18¾ by 15¼;
Copy, 20 by 16; Large Post, 20¾ by 16½; Medium
Post, 18 by 23; Sheet-and-third Foolscap, 23
by 13¼; Sheet-and-half Foolscap, 24½ by 13¼;
Double Foolscap, 27 by 17; Double Pot, 30 by
25; Double Post, 30½ by 19; Double Crown, 20
by 30; Demy, 20 by 15½; ditto Printing, 22½ by

The different sizes of letter and note paper
ordinarily used are prepared from those kinds
by the stationer, whose business consists chiefly
in smoothing the edges of the paper, and afterwards
packing it up in some tasteful form, which
serves to attract attention.</p>

<p>Under the characteristic names of coarse
papers may be mentioned Kent Cap, 21 by 18;
Bag Cap, 19½ by 24; Havon Cap, 21 by 26;
Imperial Cap, 22 by 29; Double 2-lb., 17 by 24;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Double 4-lb., 21 by 30; Double 6-lb., 19 by 28;
Casing of various dimensions, also Cartridges, with
other descriptive names, besides Middle Hand,
22 by 16; Lumber Hand, 19½ by 29; Royal Hand,
20 by 25; Double Small Hand, 19 by 29; and of
the purples, such significations as Copy Loaf,
16¾ by 21¾, 38-lb.; Powder Loaf, 18 by 26, 58-lb.;
Double Loaf, 16½ by 23, 48-lb.; Single Loaf, 21½
by 27, 78-lb.; Lump, 23 by 33, 100-lb.; Hambro’,
16½ by 23, 48-lb.; Titler, 29 by 35, 120-lb.;
Prussian or Double Lump, 32 by 42, 200-lb.; and
so forth, with glazed boards, of various sizes, used
chiefly by printers, for pressing, which are manufactured
in a peculiar manner by hand, the
boards being severally composed of various
sheets made in the ordinary way, but turned off
the mould one sheet upon another, until the
required substance be attained; a felt is then
placed upon the mass and another board formed.
By this means, the sheets, when pressed, adhere
more effectually to each other, and the boards
consequently become much more durable than
would be the case if they were produced by
pasting. Indeed, if any great amount of heat be
applied to pasteboards, they will split, and be
rendered utterly useless. The glazing in this
case is accomplished by friction.</p>

<p>To complete the category of coarse papers, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
ought to mention, as coming within the range
of the Excise, Milled Boards, employed in bookbinding,
of not less than one hundred and fifty
descriptions, that is, as regards sizes and substances.
Still, however, an incomplete idea
is conveyed of the extraordinary number of
sizes and descriptions into which paper is at
present divided. For instance, I have said with
reference to writing qualities, that there are
<em>five</em> kinds, cream wove, yellow wove, blue wove,
cream laid, and blue laid, and again, that of each
of those kinds there are numerous sizes; but in
addition there are, as a matter of course, various
thicknesses and makes of each size and kind.
In fact, no house in London, carrying on the
wholesale stationery trade, is without a thousand
different sorts; many keep stock of twice that
number.</p>

<p>So much having of late been said with reference
to a repeal of what are termed “Taxes on
Knowledge,” occasioning thereby many very
erroneous opinions, it may be useful to offer
some remarks upon Excise Regulations in connection
with the duty on paper. And, in adverting
to those regulations, we shall have an opportunity
for observing the gradual increase which has
taken place in the consumption, which in some
measure tends to illustrate national advancement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
in the arts and sciences, and the general extension
of literary pursuits. The Excise duty on paper
was first imposed in the reign of Queen Anne.
The statute, bearing date 1711, recites as a reason
for the grant—which no doubt corresponds with
that of <em>our</em> Chancellor of the Exchequer for its
continuance—“the necessity of raising large
supplies of money to carry on the present war,
until your Majesty shall be enabled to establish
a good and lasting peace.” The duties at that
time were charged on the ream, at rates varying
according to the kind of paper, which was for
this purpose divided into numerous denominations
or classes, thus—“That there shall be
raised, levyed, collected, and paid to and for the
use of her Majesty, her heires and successors,
for and upon all paper of what kind soever——which
shall at any time or times within, or
during the terme of 32 years, to be reckoned
from the foure and twentieth day of June, one
thousand seven hundred and twelve, be made in
Great Britaine, the severall and respective duties
hereinafter menc̄oned, that is to say, for and
upon all paper usually called or knowne by the
name of demy fine, which shall be soe made in
Great Britaine, the sume of one shilling and sixpence
for every reame, and after that rate for a
greater or lesser quantity.” And in like manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
it goes on, fixing the amount per ream to be paid
for second demy, fine and second crown, fine and
second foolscap, fine and second pott, brown,
large cap, small ordinary brown, whited brown,
pasteboards, and lastly, “For and upon all other
paper, white or browne, or of any other colour
or kind whatsoever, which shall be made in Great
Britaine as aforesaid, (not being particularly
charged in this Act,) a duty after the rate of
twelve pounds for every one hundred pounds of
the true and reall value of the same, and after
that rate for any greater or lesser quantities,
which said duties for and upon the said severall
sorts of paper and other the commodities last
menc̄oned to be made in Great Britaine, shall be
paid by the makers thereof respectively.” But
this method of drawing distinctions between different
qualities and sizes of paper, being found
to lead to frequent disputes with the Excise,
and great inequality in the charge on the manufactured
article at different mills, alterations
were gradually made, till at length it was enacted
in the 43rd year of the reign of George III.,
“that all paper and pasteboards should be considered
first class, and subject to 3d. per lb. duty,
unless made wholly out of old tarred rope and
cordage, without extracting therefrom the pitch
or tar, or any part thereof,” and the Act further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
says, “and without any mixture of other materials
therewith;” and “that for every pound weight
avoirdupois of paper made in Great Britain, of
the second class or denomination, that is to say,
all brown paper made of old ropes or cordage
only, as aforesaid, a duty of 1½d. per lb.” The
professed object of the last mentioned Act being
a simplification of the mode of charging the
duties, the numerous distinct classes into which
paper had been divided being here reduced to
two. But again, evasion of the law was soon
discovered to be practicable. Either by a partial
purification of the tarred rope, selecting also that
which was most whitened by use and exposure,
and then charging the paper so made (which was
nearly equal to first class in marketable value)
with the second class duty; or as tarred rope
increased in price, and some sorts of first class
material very considerably declined, the great
temptation of an extensive evasion of the law
necessarily followed, by the use of first class
material in second class paper.</p>

<p>Whether the duty on paper as now imposed,
or the Excise regulations under which that duty
is collected, be the more objectionable, is perhaps
difficult to say. Of course, the paper-maker is
subjected to considerable annoyance, and the
publisher compelled to submit to an outlay which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
he deems unjust, and would very happily dispense
with; but the public are not really affected by it
to the extent it is customary to suppose. The
duty at present levied upon paper of all kinds is
<em>fourteen guineas</em> per ton, or a little more than
three halfpence per lb. When, therefore, we hear
men pronouncing it “a most obnoxious tax,” and
one “directly opposed to the advancement of
literature,” I freely confess that, for my own part,
I hesitate very much to reiterate their sentiments.</p>

<p>Some, however, prefer an intermediate course,
and propose a <em>partial</em> abolition of the duty. Mr.
Charles Dickens has favoured us with a suggestion
to this effect: he says, “In England, where
<em>coloured</em> paper is so little used, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer might as well, as not, take off the
duty altogether from coloured paper. It would
cost the revenue a mere trifle, while it would be a
vast boon to the public.” But what induces this
assertion? If coloured paper is so little used, the
trifling reduction could not be considered a <em>vast
boon</em>. And one would like to know how or where
it would be possible to draw a line of distinction
between such papers as are coloured and those
which are not. I happen to be in a position to
assert that there is no class of paper whatever,
which is not tinted more or less by different manufacturers.
To suggest then a partial repeal of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
duty upon such grounds, is, I apprehend, useless.
If it had been confessed that the reduction would
be a boon to the publisher, I should promptly
have assented, simply because I am equally well
aware that printing paper may be slightly tinted,
with considerable advantage both as regards
setting off the type, and the general appearance
of a work; consequently if such really were to
the public a boon, to the publisher it would be
very considerably increased.</p>

<p>However, in order that we may not be supposed
to lean to the present regulations, I shall refer to
one or two clauses of the Act which I have no
doubt will suffice to show, that while in itself it
is very far from perfect in its operation, as protecting
the interests of those concerned, it is equally
unsatisfactory, and in some respects unjust.</p>

<p>I shall observe, that with regard to the Tax
itself, I simply question whether it would be
possible to impose one less injurious to the well-being
of society, and against which, as of
necessity, fewer persons could have cause to
murmur, than the existing duty on paper. The
sections of the Act to which I content myself
with calling attention, are <em>three</em>, affecting the
convenience and interest of the manufacturer,
and <em>one</em> which offers a ready opportunity for an
act of seeming dishonesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Every step of the manufacture of paper must
be conducted under the surveillance of the
Excise, and the provisions as to entries, folding,
weighing, sorting, labelling, removing, and so on,
are not only exceedingly numerous and vexatious,
but enforced under heavy penalties. For instance,
every paper maker is required by sections 20 &amp;
21, to provide suitable scales and weights for the
use of the Excise, and also to assist the officer in
what we might conceive to be the execution of his
peculiar duty, under the penalties, in the former
case of £100., and in the latter, £50. for every
refusal or neglect. To many manufacturers the
cost of this extra labour alone becomes an important
consideration.</p>

<p>Again, in the instance of procuring the Excise
labels, which have to be pasted on each ream,
section 9 requires that every one signed for by
the workman on delivery, must be produced or
accounted for, under a penalty of £10. each,
which is equal to the duty upon no less than
1600 lbs. weight of paper; an idea necessarily
inconsistent with that of its being packed in one
parcel; and therefore, since for every time we
divide such quantity, an additional label is required,
a very forcible argument against so
excessive a penalty may readily be deduced.</p>

<p>The labels employed are of three colours,—red,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
blue, and green; denoting in which part of
the kingdom the paper was made. Red being
used for England; blue, for Scotland; and green
for Ireland.</p>

<p>The 27th section of the Act, relating to the
real and nominal weight of each ream or parcel,
is that to which I have referred as being liable
to deceptive or dishonest purposes. It runs thus—“And
be it enacted—That if any ream, &amp;c.,
be found to weigh under or over the weight
marked, in the proportion of 5 per centum, if
the weight marked on such ream exceed twenty
pounds, or 10 per centum if such weight be
twenty pounds or less, the same shall be forfeited.”</p>

<p>Of course there is no necessity for a proviso
lest the maker should give a preference to an
increase of weight upon that marked, but since
some cylinder dried papers are apt afterwards to
increase in weight, the addition is requisite to
prevent unjust seizure. However, in all probability,
at the suggestion of the paper maker, when
aiding the Excise, in consequence of a great
quantity to be charged, it has become customary
to average the weight of a draft, instead of
putting each ream separately into the scale.
Thus the practicability of rendering this clause
highly objectionable will be at once apparent,
and deserves to be pointed out for the purpose of
warning against the temptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The quantity of paper manufactured in this
country at the commencement of the eighteenth
century, when the duty was first imposed, appears
to have been far from sufficient to meet the necessities
of the time. Even in 1721, it is supposed
that there were but about 300,000 reams of paper
annually produced in Great Britain, which were
equal merely to two-thirds of the consumption.
But in 1784, the value of the paper manufactured
in England alone is stated to have amounted to
£800,000.; and that, by reason of the increase in
price, as also of its use, in less than twenty years,
it nearly doubled that amount.</p>

<p>I have extracted, from a Parliamentary report,
various returns relating to the Excise duties
levied upon paper, which, since an article of the
kind is necessarily subjected to great alteration
in value, according to the scarcity or abundance
of raw materials, are, of course, better calculated
to show a steady increase in the demand, than
any mere references to statements of supposed
value, from time to time.</p>

<p>In one return, specifying the rates of duty
and amount of duty received upon each denomination
of paper since 1770, it appears that the
total amount of duty on paper manufactured in
England for the year 1784, to which I have just
alluded as being estimated in value at £800,000.,
was £46,867. 19s. 9¼d., the duty at that time being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
divided into seven distinct classes or rates of collection;
while twenty years after, when the mode
of assessing the duty was reduced to but three
classes, it had risen to £315,802. 4s. 8d.; in
1830, fifteen years after, to £619,824. 7s. 11d.; in
1835, for the United Kingdom, to £833,822. 12s.
4d., or, in weight, to 70,655,287 lbs., which was,
again, within so short a period as fifteen years,
very nearly doubled. The quantity of paper
charged with Excise duty in the United Kingdom,
being, in 1850, no less than 141,032,474 lbs.,
and last year (1854) the enormous weight of
179,896,222 lbs.</p>

<p>Those observations, which are partly technical,
because, without technicality, the view would be
incomplete,—may give some idea of the skill
required in the workman, and the expenditure
demanded of the capitalist, to produce so simple
a thing, as a sheet of paper. The most exact care,
the most ingenious invention, the nicest work of
hand, and the most complicated machinery, are
essential to that superiority which the British
manufacture of paper has at length established.</p>

<p>But the capabilities of paper are still more
extensive. There are probably few branches of
use, taste, or ornament, to which it may not be
applicable. We have it already moulded into
many forms of utility, and even of elegance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
under the well-known name of <i lang="fr">papier mache</i>—a
material which may yet be formed into works
of art, painted and enamelled tables, antique
candelabra, models of busts, statuettes, classic
temples, and everything which can be shaped in
a mould.</p>

<p>An earlier and more important use of Paper is
in the decoration of dwellings. Formerly, the
apartments of persons of opulence were hung with
tapestry, generally brought from the Continental
loom. But its cost, its loss of colour by time;
and the rise of commercial and industrial
opulence, displaced this elaborate and heavy
decoration, and substituted “<em>paper hangings</em>.”
The first specimens of those exhibited nothing
but the rudeness of an art in its infancy, and
were almost wholly foreign; but the capability
of the invention was large, and it had the
advantage of converting the humble covering
of walls into copies of the pencil, on a new
and extended scale. The Continental specimens
of this manufacture already display representations
of leading national events, memorable
battles, and even portraits of eminent men,
forming, for even the humbler ranks, a kind of
historic galleries.</p>

<p>The English manufacturer excels in the proportions
of his paper, (English, 12 yards long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
by 21 inches wide; French, 9 yards, by 18
inches). But, the art is still difficult and costly;
the blocks for a single pattern sometimes
amounting to thousands. One of the principal
French manufacturers is, at present, producing
a design, requiring upwards of three thousand
blocks, at a cost of £2000., the design alone
costing £1200.</p>

<p>But, time and practice will lighten both the
difficulty and the expense. The manufacture
may yet spread through every mart in the world.
In its more advanced stage, it may supply the
place of <span class="smcap">Fresco</span>, or rather be a multiplied Fresco.</p>

<p>The Cartoons of Raphael, the noblest work of
design, are upon paper; the finest Italian pictures
might be copied upon paper; and the tardy and
toilsome work of the Engraver might be exchanged
for the rapid, cheap, and popular design, no longer
limited to the palace or the cloister, but sent, in
thousands of copies, round the globe. Nor let
this be called Utopian; what can be Utopian,
in the country of the Railroad, the Steam-ship,
and the Electric Telegraph!</p>

<p>The art wants only public encouragement.
Let the encouragement be given, and the talent
will be found. Let Government offer a premium
of even a thousand pounds for the best specimen.
Let the Society of Arts make it one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the objects of their patronage; let it be once
favoured, and it will soon advance to excellence.</p>

<p>Nor let any one scoff at the interest, which I
venture to express in the ornament even of a
cottage wall. Ornament is the crown of art.
Taste is thought. Elegance is the refinement of
civilization. The study of beauty, grandeur,
and truth, in History and in Nature, is the most
practical education of man! Who shall say, that
the sight of some heroic action—some noble
figure of history—some sublime exercise of
talent, magnanimity, or patriotism, pictured on a
cottage wall,—may not be like a flash through
the darkness of the peasant heart; may not
suddenly awake the latent energy of the unconscious
poet, the patriot, and the hero; may not
give to the world a <ins class="corr" id="tn-116" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Shakespeare'">
Shakspeare</ins>, a Wallace, or a
Wellington!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
